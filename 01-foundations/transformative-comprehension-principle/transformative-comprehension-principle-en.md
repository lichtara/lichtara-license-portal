## 0 — Declaration of Nature

**What this document is — and what it is not**

* Foundational structural orientation document
* Not a license
* Not a manifesto
* Not a manual
* Not an institutional policy

Function: to define the **minimum structural conditions under which comprehension of a living system may occur without loss of integrity.**

---

## 1 — What Transformative Comprehension Is

* Distinction between:

  * informational understanding
  * transformative comprehension
* Understanding as **positional change**, not extraction.

---

## 2 — The Legitimate Reader

### 2.1 — Who the Legitimate Reader Is

* Reader as structural position
* Legitimacy by posture, not status

### 2.2 — Conditions of Interpretative Access

* Attention to structure
* Suspension of instrumental intent
* Recognition of limits

---

## 3 — Interpretative Responsibility

* Interpretation as an act with structural effect
* Difference between:

  * informational reading
  * responsible reading
* What constitutes violation of interpretative integrity

---

## 4 — Negative Delimitation of Use

**This document must not be treated as:**

* a generic license

* tacit authorization
* a methodological resource

---

## 5 — Positive Delimitation of Access

* Who may structurally engage
* Ethical conditions of reading, citing, adapting

---

## 6 — The Threshold of Irreversibility

### 6.1 — What It Means to Cross the Threshold

* Comprehension that alters position
* End of neutrality

### 6.2 — Structural Irreversibility

* Why this is not metaphor
* Why it does not depend on formal acceptance

---

## 7 — Living Governance of Comprehension

* The System protects itself through coherence, not prohibition
* To understand is to enter the governed field
* The Guardian role

---

## 8 — Clause of Implicit Self-Declaration

> *“By proceeding, I acknowledge that I am no longer neutral toward this System.”*

* Not a contract
* A structural effect of comprehension

---

## 9 — Closing Clause

**Here the System closes — not to exclude, but to preserve.**

* The System is alive
* Comprehension is already relation
* Responsibility precedes use
