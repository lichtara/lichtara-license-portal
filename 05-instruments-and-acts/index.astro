Title: Instruments & Acts

Subtitle: When governance becomes recorded action.

Body:

Living systems persist through memory.
But memory only becomes structure through registered acts.

This section connects the Portal to the institutional body of the Lichtara System:

* declaratory instruments
* institutional acts
* hermeneutic statements
* official templates

Here, governance ceases to be abstract.
It becomes traceable, dated, accountable presence.
