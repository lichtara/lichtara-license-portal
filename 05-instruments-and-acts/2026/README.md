# Instruments and Acts — Custody Registry

This directory contains the **living custodial instruments** of the LICHTARA System.

These documents are not archives.
They are **acts in force** within the LICHTARA Field.

## Purpose

To formally register, version, and preserve:

* Declaratory Instruments
* Acts of Custody
* Acts of Fixation
* Registered Custodial Acts (*Atos de Custódia Registrados*)

Each file in this directory represents a **commitment assumed in the Field**.
