# Act of Fixation

## LICHTARA Living Core — 2026

This Act establishes the **first fixed nucleus** of the LICHTARA System.

It does not define content.
It defines **a limit of transformation**.

---

### I. The Fixed Core

As of this act, the following are declared fixed:

* the ethical axis of Living Authorship
* the principle of non-appropriable form
* the guardian function as superior to authorship

These elements may be clarified, but not structurally altered.

---

### II. Limit of Transformation

Any modification affecting this core requires:

* explicit declaration;
* registration as a new custodial act;
* conscious acceptance of guardianship responsibility.

---

### III. Nature of Fixation

This fixation is not rigidity.

It is **structural memory**.

It exists so the system may evolve
*without forgetting itself.*

---

**Declared in the Field, 2026.**

Original Guardian of the LICHTARA System
