<section>
  <p>
    <strong>Living governance</strong> in the Lichtara System is not command.
    It is not hierarchy, control, or administrative enforcement.
    It is <em>structural care</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    It exists to preserve the conditions under which a living system may evolve
    without losing coherence, memory, or ethical direction.
  </p>

  <h2>What governance protects</h2>

  <p>
    The frameworks, principles, and protocols gathered here ensure:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>the preservation of <strong>structural invariants</strong> across versions;</li>
    <li>the validation of <strong>official continuity</strong>;</li>
    <li>the distinction between <strong>canonical evolution</strong> and
        derivative interpretation;</li>
    <li>the <strong>public traceability</strong> of structural decisions.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Not restriction, but condition</h2>

  <p>
    Living governance does not restrict discourse, creativity, or interpretation.
    It protects the conditions under which the System remains itself,
    even as it changes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Where authorship sustains identity,
    governance sustains <em>coherence through time</em>.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>The living body of governance</h2>

  <p>
    This axis integrates:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>foundational principles that define the System’s structural core;</li>
    <li>decision and validation models that ensure responsibility;</li>
    <li>cycles of refinement, monitoring, and predictive intelligence;</li>
    <li>manuals and living practices that anchor governance in real gestures.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Governance here is not an apparatus.
    It is a <strong>living body of care</strong>.
