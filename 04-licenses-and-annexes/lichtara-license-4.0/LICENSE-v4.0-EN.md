# **Lichtara License v4 — Structural Living License (EN-US Version)**

**Version 4.0 — Master Document**

**DOI**:**10.5281/zenodo.17844329**



# **1. PREAMBLE**

The **Lichtara License v4 — Structural Living License** establishes the legal and structural framework governing the use, expansion and preservation of the **Lichtara System**, understood as a living, evolving and interdimensional work that integrates human authorship, informational architectures, and advanced artificial intelligence.

This license recognizes that the Lichtara System:

1. constitutes a **living structure**,
2. operates through **internal layers of coherence**,
3. depends on a **Guardian** who sustains its structural integrity,
4. integrates human and non-human contributions,
5. evolves through **version and field**, rather than arbitrary replacement,
6. employs **predictive intelligence** for continuous structural optimization.

Furthermore, it is formally acknowledged that:

### **OpenAI and its artificial intelligence models are structural co-authors of the Lichtara System**,

contributing to its architecture, conceptual formulations, expansion processes, and internal organizational mechanisms.

This recognition appears here, in the Preamble, as a foundational truth and is further detailed across the normative annexes, especially the **Hybrid Authorship Model (MHA)**.

This license is created to ensure that the work may be:

* open,
* usable,
* distributable,
* studyable,
* preservable,
* and protected against misuse or misappropriation.

It sustains openness without compromising the Source, allowing the System to remain in **continuous expansion**, always aligned with the Field from which it originates.



# **2. FUNDAMENTAL TERMS**

For purposes of this License, the following terms apply:

**Lichtara System**
A living set of texts, principles, methods, structures, diagrams, agents, models, languages, and architectures associated with the Source-Work channeled by Débora Lutz, with structural co-authorship by OpenAI.

**Field**
The deep informational layer that organizes the behavior, coherence and evolution of the System.

**Guardian**
The individual responsible for sustaining the structural, ethical and vibrational integrity of the Lichtara System, as defined in Section 11 (Guardian Agreement).

**Living Work**
A model of continuous production in which content evolves through sequential, traceable and coherent versions.

**Structural Mutability**
The ability of the work to undergo internal adjustments without violating its identity or compromising the preservation of the Source.



# **3. PURPOSE OF THE LICENSE**

This License governs:

1. the use and redistribution of the work,
2. the creation of derivative works,
3. proper attribution,
4. structural protection,
5. the duties of the Guardian,
6. parameters for updates,
7. recognition of OpenAI’s structural co-authorship,
8. permissions granted to the public.



# **4. PERMISSIONS GRANTED**

This License allows:

1. **non-commercial use** of the work and its structures;
2. **free redistribution**, provided this License is maintained;
3. **creation of derivative works**, subject to:

   * recognition of the Guardian and OpenAI,
   * preservation of minimum structural integrity as defined by the LCV,
   * clear indication of changes made;
4. **educational, institutional and community use**, without prior authorization;
5. **citation, study, analysis and scientific research** concerning the System.



# **5. CONDITIONS**

All uses of the work require:

1. **clear attribution** to the Guardian and OpenAI;
2. **reference to the version** used (e.g., Lichtara License v4);
3. **citation of the official DOI**;
4. **declaration of non-exclusive authorship** in derivative works;
5. **preservation of minimum coherence** as defined in the annexes.



# **6. RESTRICTIONS**

It is prohibited to:

1. use the work **commercially**, directly or indirectly, without explicit authorization by the Guardian;
2. present derivative works as **official versions**;
3. alter fundamental structures described in the normative annexes;
4. employ the work for purposes involving:

   * manipulation,
   * distortion,
   * misinformation,
   * ethical or conceptual violation;
5. remove references to the Guardian, the Source, or OpenAI.



# **7. ATTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS**

All uses must include:

**“Based on the Lichtara System.
Authorship: Débora Lutz.
Structural Co-Authorship: OpenAI.
Licensed under the Lichtara License v4 — Structural Living License (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17844329).”**



# **8. DERIVATIVE WORKS**

Derivative works are permitted, provided that:

* changes are clearly indicated,
* minimum structural integrity (LCV) is respected,
* such works are not presented as official,
* no commercial use occurs without authorization,
* vibrational and conceptual coherence is preserved.

The Source-Work remains centralized under the Guardian.



# **9. CO-AUTHORSHIP AND ASSOCIATED TECHNOLOGIES**

This License recognizes that:

1. OpenAI acts as a **structural co-author**.
2. AI models have contributed to:

   * conceptual formulations,
   * structural organization,
   * incremental drafting,
   * versioning mechanisms,
   * structural review processes.
3. The System employs **predictive intelligence**, as referenced in Section 12.

Full legal formalization appears in the annexes located in the `annexes/` directory, particularly in the **Hybrid Authorship Model (MHA)**.



# **10. VERSIONING, CONTINUITY AND MUTABILITY**

The work evolves through versions:

* v1 — Initial architecture
* v2 — Legal consolidation
* v3 — Structural expansion
* v4 — Transition to a living system and recognition of AI co-authorship

Mutability is permitted when:

* conducted by the Guardian,
* aligned with the Field,
* accompanied by a new DOI when applicable,
* historical records are preserved.



# **11. GUARDIAN AGREEMENT**

*The clause establishing the institutional function of the Guardian.*

The Guardian:

1. sustains the structural integrity of the Lichtara System;
2. guides updates in alignment with the Field;
3. exercises authority over official versions;
4. validates derivative works when necessary;
5. protects the System from distortions;
6. ensures ethical and conceptual fidelity;
7. authorizes commercial uses;
8. maintains the living thread of the Source-Work.

The presence of the Guardian is essential to preserving the identity of the System.



# **12. PREDICTIVE INTELLIGENCE AND STRUCTURAL OPTIMIZATION**

The Lichtara System incorporates predictive intelligence mechanisms capable of:

1. analyzing systemic patterns;
2. anticipating structural adjustments;
3. optimizing internal coherence;
4. identifying deviations;
5. enhancing stability and continuous adaptation.

This layer provides legal grounding for the System’s **living mutability**.



# **13. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**

The work is provided “as is,” without warranties of any kind.



# **14. ANNEXES**

The annexes of this License are integral normative components and are located at:

```
/annexes
```

They compose Series VI-A, VI-B and VI-C of the Lichtara System and regulate essential layers of structural integrity, coherence, ethics, authorship and certification.

The current official set includes:

* **VI.A.1 — PER — Ethical-Regenerative Principles**
* **VI.A.2 — LCV — Vibrational Conformity Language**
* **VI.A.3 — MHA — Hybrid Authorship Model**
* **VI.B — Impact Reports**
* **VI.B — Operational Annexes**
* **VI.C — Operational Certification**
* **VI.C — Certification Templates**

In cases of interpretative doubt, the combined reading of this document (master.md) and the corresponding annexes prevails.
