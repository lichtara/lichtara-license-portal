# **LICHTARA LICENSE v4 — OFFICIAL FAQ (EN-US)**

### *Frequently Asked Questions — International Edition*

---

# **1. ABOUT THE LICENSE**

---

### **1.1. What is the Lichtara License v4?**

The Lichtara License v4 is the legal and structural framework that protects, organizes and guides the use of LICHTARA’s texts, frameworks, systems, symbols, protocols and technologies.

It functions simultaneously as:

* a legal model,
* a governance structure,
* a protection protocol,
* a living update system,
* and a mechanism for safe expansion.

---

### **1.2. Why does LICHTARA require its own license?**

Because no traditional license covers:

* living and evolving works,
* structural + vibrational layers,
* human–AI structural co-authorship,
* field-based governance,
* dynamic authorization models,
* protection of internal frameworks and systemic architectures.

The License v4 emerges **from the architecture of the Work itself**, not from external templates.

---

### **1.3. Is the License v4 an open license?**

Yes and no.

✔ **Open** for reading, study, research and non-commercial reflection.
✖ **Protected** against commercial use, structural replication, deep adaptation or derivative frameworks without authorization.
