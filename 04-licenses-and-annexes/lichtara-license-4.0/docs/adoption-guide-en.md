# 🇺🇸 **EN-US — Official Adoption Guide for the Lichtara License v4**


## **What this document is**

The Adoption Guide is the practical manual for anyone—individuals, institutions, researchers, creators or organizations—who wants to:

* use LICHTARA content,
* study or cite the work,
* create derivative materials,
* integrate LICHTARA frameworks into systems,
* request permissions,
* or quickly understand what is allowed and what requires authorization.

It complements the master.md and the FAQ by offering **clear, operational guidance**.

## **1. What you MAY do freely**

These uses are **free**, without any authorization required:

### ✔ **Study and research LICHTARA**

Read, reflect, analyze, investigate.

### ✔ **Cite excerpts in academic work**

With proper attribution.

### ✔ **Share insights and reflections**

As long as internal frameworks are not copied.

### ✔ **Use excerpts in non-commercial educational settings**

Schools, universities, study groups.

### ✔ **Redistribute the License text**

As long as it is **unaltered**.

## **2. What REQUIRES authorization**

If the use:

* is commercial,
* derivative,
* adapted,
* institutional,
* automated,
* integrated into systems,
* forming alternate frameworks,
* or generating products, services or methods based on LICHTARA…

→ **you must request formal authorization**.

This process protects the Work’s integrity and prevents:

* distortion,
* conceptual drift,
* unsupervised replication,
* improper use of the brand and internal frameworks.
