# **EN-US — Developer Technical Guide**


# **1. Purpose of this Guide**

This document guides:

* developers,
* technical teams,
* software engineers,
* system architects,
* AI researchers,
* integration creators,

on **how to work with the LICHTARA System while respecting the v4 License, the Structural Core and Field integrity**.

---

# **2. Fundamental Technical Principles**

### **2.1. Structural Preservation**

Internal structures described in PER, LCV and MHA **may not be replicated or adapted**.

### **2.2. No Reproduction of Internal Frameworks**

Models, agents, architectures, languages or mechanisms of coherence cannot be reproduced to create parallel systems.

### **2.3. Integration Transparency**

All integrations must be clear, documented and traceable.

### **2.4. No Automation Without Oversight**

Bots, scripts and automated tools require authorization.

### **2.5. Source Protection**

It is prohibited to:

* export internal content to open datasets,
* train AI models using LICHTARA texts,
* derive models based on its structural language.

---

# **3. Technically Allowed**

### ✔ **Referencing the License v4 in projects**

Including badges, links and short-forms.

### ✔ **Tools that only display LICHTARA content**

Without altering structure or semantics.

### ✔ **High-level visualizations**

Graphs, diagrams, maps — without exposing internal logic.

### ✔ **Technical research and comparative studies**

### ✔ **Using the License v4 as a documentation component**

---

# **4. Uses that REQUIRE authorization**

### 🔸 **System, API or platform integrations**

### 🔸 **Any type of automation**

Bots, agents, scripted functions.

### 🔸 **Data modeling based on LICHTARA frameworks**

### 🔸 **Use in commercial products or platforms**

### 🔸 **Machine learning research using LICHTARA data**

---

# **5. Technically Prohibited**

### ✖ **Systems imitating LICHTARA’s structural language**

### ✖ **AI training using LICHTARA content**

### ✖ **Creating frameworks “based on LICHTARA”**

### ✖ **Automating LICHTARA for structural interpretation**

### ✖ **Unauthorized commercial integrations**

---

# **6. Technical Request Procedure**

Send:

```
admin@deboralutz.com
Subject: Technical Request — License v4
```

Include:

* system architecture,
* technical justification,
* predicted impact,
* data flow diagrams,
* security measures,
* purpose,
* responsible team.

---

# **7. Quick Compliance Checklist**

Before developing, ask:

1. Does this alter LICHTARA’s structure?
2. Does this automate LICHTARA?
3. Does this replicate internal frameworks?
4. Does this generate economic value?
5. Does this expose internal content?

If **yes** to any → authorization is required.
