## **LICHTARA LICENSE v4.1 — APPLICATION AND INTERPRETATION MANUAL (EN)**

*(Official Document · Non-Normative · Interpretative and Operational)*

---

## **1. Nature and Function of the Manual**

This Manual is intended to **guide the correct, coherent, and faithful application** of the LICHTARA License.

It is:

* **official** — formally recognized by LICHTARA Governance;
* **non-normative** — it does not create rights, duties, or exceptions;
* **interpretative** — it clarifies the meaning of existing provisions;
* **operational** — it supports practical decisions, audits, and institutional responses.

This Manual **does not replace**:

* Section I — General Principles;
* Section II — Legal and Operational Provisions;
* Annexes A, B, and C.

In case of conflict, **the License text shall always prevail**.

**Operational Note M.1.1** —
This Manual exists to prevent interpretative distortions, not to flexibilize Limits.

---

## **2. How to Interpret the License**

### **2.1 Principle of Hierarchical Reading**

All interpretation shall respect the following hierarchy:

1. **General Principles (Section I)**
2. **Operational Provisions (Section II)**
3. **Annexes (A, B, C)**
4. **This Manual**

No interpretation shall be considered valid if it:

* contradicts the Principles;
* expands permissions by analogy;
* reduces Limits for convenience;
* invokes normative silence as authorization.

### **2.2 Restrictive Interpretation of Permissions**

Permissions shall be interpreted:

* **restrictively**;
* according to the **level of access granted**;
* always subordinated to the **Form** and to the **LCV**.

In the presence of doubt:

> **activity must be interrupted** until formal clarification is obtained.

**Operational Note M.2.1** —
Doubt does not authorize exploratory action.

---

## **3. How to Audit Use, Access, and Implementation**

### **3.1 When to Audit**

An audit may be initiated:

* preventively;
* upon substantiated complaint;
* upon indication of violation;
* through periodic sampling;
* upon external institutional request.

No prior notice is required when the integrity of the System **or of the Form** is at risk.

### **3.2 What to Audit**

The audit shall verify:

* the level of access effectively exercised;
* the existence of valid certification, where applicable;
* compliance with the applicable usage regime;
* preservation of the Form;
* observance of the LCV;
* traceability of actions;
* coherence between public representation and actual authorization.

### **3.3 Accepted Evidence**

The following may be used as evidence:

* documentary records;
* public or institutional materials;
* contracts and authorizations;
* formal communications;
* derivative products, courses, or systems;
* technical or operational logs.

**Operational Note M.3.1** —
Lack of traceability in itself constitutes non-compliance.

## **4. How to Handle Infractions**

### **4.1 Initial Classification**

An infraction shall be classified as:

* **unauthorized use**;
* **material infraction**;
* **serious violation**;
* **structural violation** (Form and/or LCV).

Classification **does not depend on declared intent**, but on **objective effects**.

### **4.2 Good Faith and Incomprehension**

Good faith **does not exclude responsibility** when:

* canonical documents were accessible;
* activity continued despite relevant doubt;
* there was clear scope overreach.

Incomprehension is **never exculpatory after access**.

### **4.3 Immediate Measures**

Upon confirmation of an infraction, Governance may:

* order immediate interruption of activity;
* suspend access;
* request formal clarification;
* preserve evidence;
* communicate risks to affected third parties.

---

## **5. How to Apply Sanctions**

### **5.1 Criteria for Application**

Sanctions shall be applied taking into account, cumulatively:

* the **level of access** exercised by the agent;
* the **severity of the violation**;
* the **extent of the impact** caused;
* the **risk posed to the Form and to the LCV**;
* **recurrence** of violations;
* the degree of **cooperation following the infraction**.

### **5.2 Types of Sanction**

The following sanctions may be applied, individually or cumulatively:

* formal warning;
* suspension of access;
* revocation of certification;
* termination of the relationship;
* future prohibition of use;
* structured public notice;
* applicable judicial or legal measures.

**Operational Note M.5.1** —
Protection of the **Form** prevails over gradual proportionality.

---

## **6. How to Certify**

### **6.1 Principles of Certification**

Certification shall observe:

* the **actual necessity of access**;
* **ethical and structural compatibility**;
* the agent’s **capacity to preserve the Form**;
* demonstrated **understanding of the Limits**;
* **explicit adherence to the LCV**.

Certification is **not a reward**, nor a symbolic or reputational recognition.
It is the **attribution of increased responsibility**.

### **6.2 General Process**

The minimum certification process includes:

1. formal request;
2. analysis of the intended scope;
3. definition of access level and usage regime;
4. express acceptance of duties;
5. documentary record;
6. audit provision.

### **6.3 Denial or Revocation**

Governance may:

* deny certification without detailed public justification;
* revoke certification at any time;
* condition its maintenance on continuous conformity.

**Operational Note M.6.1** —
Certification does not generate acquired rights.

---

## **7. Boundary Cases and Unforeseen Situations**

In situations not expressly provided for:

* the **most restrictive interpretation shall apply**;
* preservation of the **Form** shall take precedence;
* activity shall be **interrupted** until a formal decision is issued.

No alleged urgency, opportunity, or benefit
authorizes unilateral action outside the License.

---

## **8. Final Provision of the Manual**

This Manual exists to:

* **protect the System**;
* **protect the agents**;
* **preserve the Form over time**;
* **prevent capture, trivialization, or distortion**.

It does not flexibilize the License.
It **keeps it legible, applicable, and intact**.

Within the LICHTARA System,
to interpret correctly
is an essential part of **any legitimate operation**.
