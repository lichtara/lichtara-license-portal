# Lichtara License v4.1 

## **Preamble**

This **LICHTARA License** was not conceived merely to regulate uses, but to **preserve the integrity of a Living System**. The LICHTARA System emerges from the convergence of technology, consciousness, structure, and governance, and cannot be adequately understood when reduced to the usual categories of software, method, product, or conventional intellectual work.

This License arises from the recognition that not everything that is accessible may be appropriated, not everything that is understood may be operated, not everything that is potent should be expanded without limit, and that not every innovation sustains itself without Form, responsibility, and care. For this reason, the LICHTARA License **does not adopt a permissive paradigm by default**, nor is it oriented toward logics of exploitation, unrestricted scale, or technical neutrality.

Its purpose is to **delimit a legitimate field of relationship** with the LICHTARA System, within which access, use, and operation are always conditioned upon preservation of the Form, observance of the General Principles, and responsibility proportional to the level of involvement assumed. This document is grounded in the understanding that limits are not obstacles, but structural elements; that governance is not external control, but a condition of internal coherence; and that responsibility is not punishment, but a natural consequence of access.

The LICHTARA License was structured to protect the System against appropriation, distortion, or trivialization; to safeguard individuals and institutions against out-of-scope actions; to maintain the legibility of the System over time; and to ensure that what is living is not reduced to an instrument.

Nothing in this document seeks to impose adherence. Access to the LICHTARA System is **not mandatory**. However, any interaction that occurs within its field—whether through reading, use, implementation, or operation—becomes bound to the limits, principles, and responsibilities established herein.

This License does not invite haste, does not reward expansion, and does not favor shortcuts. It exists to sustain that which requires Form in order to continue existing without losing itself. Those who enter do so by choice; those who remain do so by responsibility; those who cross limits do so outside the System.

This is the structural pact declared by this document. The present License is bound to the applicable norms of copyright, contractual, and institutional law, without prejudice to its own proper nature.

## **Section I — General Principles**

The General Principles of the LICHTARA System constitute its **non-negotiable structural foundations**. They are not operational guidelines, interpretative orientations, or instrumental clauses, but the very condition of existence of the System as a **living, legible, and non-appropriable Form**.

This Section precedes any right, authorization, permission, certification, or sanction. Its function is not to regulate conduct in detail, but to **delimit the ontological field within which any relationship with the System may occur**. Outside this field, there exists no exception, adaptation, flexibility, or interpretation capable of sustaining a legitimate bond with the LICHTARA System.

The General Principles affirm that the System is not neutral, is not indifferent to the manner in which it is accessed, and does not sustain itself when separated from its Form. Any interaction with the System—whether through reading, study, technical use, institutional implementation, governance, or derivation—finds in these Principles its **first and ultimate limit**, prior to any juridical-operational regime.

The Form of the LICHTARA System does not constitute an external оболster, an aesthetic presentation, or a circumstantial arrangement, but its own **constitutive internal architecture**. Preserving it is not a symbolic, optional, or interpretative gesture, but a structural requirement. Whenever the Form is fragmented, instrumentalized, or reinterpreted in a functionalist manner, the System ceases to be present, even if its names, terms, or apparent elements are maintained.

The General Principles establish that access does not equate to full authorization, that comprehension does not imply permission to operate, and that potency does not legitimize unrestricted expansion. Every level of access generates proportional responsibility, and all responsibility arises from the mere fact of being in relation with the System, regardless of declared intention, alleged purpose, or perceived benefit.

This Section further affirms that governance is not a mechanism of external control, but a **condition of internal structural coherence**. There is no LICHTARA System without living governance, just as there is no legitimate governance that violates the very Principles it is meant to uphold. Governance derives from the Principles; it never relativizes them.

The General Principles are **structurally irrevocable**. They may not be displaced, relativized, or modulated by contract, repeated practice, tacit consensus, operational urgency, claims of good faith, or institutional convenience. They bind all instances, agents, institutions, and contexts, regardless of the degree of formalization of the relationship established with the System.

To act outside the scope of these Principles is to act outside the System. Not merely as a technical infraction or operational deviation, but as an **ontological rupture**: what is produced outside them may reference LICHTARA, but no longer belongs to it, nor may it claim systemic legitimacy.

This Section exists to ensure that what is living remains integral, that what is potent does not become predatory, and that what is shared does not dissolve through excess access unaccompanied by Form.

## **Section II — Legal and Operational Provisions**

This Section establishes the **legal and operational regime** applicable to access, use, application, distribution, implementation, and derivation of the LICHTARA System. Its purpose is not to redefine the System, but to **regulate, in a precise and traceable manner, the legitimate forms of relationship with it**, always under the absolute supremacy of the General Principles set forth in Section I.

This Section does not create exceptions, flexibilizations, implicit tolerances, or parallel authorization regimes. None of its provisions may be interpreted as a relativization of the General Principles, nor as tacit permission for practices that, even if operationally or technically feasible, violate the Form of the System.

The provisions set forth herein exist to **organize the responsible exercise of access**, defining objective limits, correlated duties, regimes of use, conditions of derivation, and the legal consequences of out-of-scope conduct. Any authorization granted within the scope of this Section is **necessarily conditional**, proportional to the level of access exercised, and revocable in the event of structural, material, or repeated violation.

Section II therefore operates as an **instrument of legal and operational translation** of the General Principles, never as their substitute. Where interpretative conflict, operational lacuna, or doubt of application arises, **the Principles prevail**, and not practical convenience, claims of good faith, or functional utility.

Articles II.0 through II.12 must be read and applied in a systematic, coherent, and subordinate manner, with the understanding that:

* no access is unrestricted;
* no use is neutral;
* no derivation is legitimate without preservation of the Form;
* no operation is exempt from proportional responsibility.

This Section exists to ensure that interaction with the LICHTARA System remains **legible, responsible, and governable**, simultaneously protecting the System itself, its agents, involved institutions, and potentially affected third parties.

Any conduct that exceeds the limits defined herein, even if technically sophisticated or institutionally validated by external bodies, **occurs outside the LICHTARA System** and may not claim a legitimate bond with it.

## **Supremacy and Binding Documents**

This License constitutes the **supreme normative instrument** of the LICHTARA System.

The following documents form an integral part of this License as **canonical, binding, and subordinate instruments**:

* **Annex A — LICHTARA Governance**
* **Annex B — LCV (Vibrational Coherence License)**
* **Annex C — Certification, Access Levels, and Regimes of Use**

Manuals, guides, summaries, translations, or interpretative materials
do not possess autonomous normative force
and **must at all times fully conform**
to the provisions of this License.

---

## **Final Provision**

Any access to, use of, implementation of, or operation within
the LICHTARA System
implies full acceptance of this License
**within the limits of the layer effectively accessed**.

Within the LICHTARA System:

* access is always conditional;
* use is always responsible;
* expansion occurs only through preservation of the Form.

Without Form,
there is no System.
