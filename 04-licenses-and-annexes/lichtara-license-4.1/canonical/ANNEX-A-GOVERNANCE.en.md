# **ANNEX A — LICHTARA GOVERNANCE**

_(Form · Limit · Authority · Responsibility)_

This Annex establishes the **legitimate governance structure**
of the LICHTARA System,
defining **competent bodies, roles, limits of authority,
decision-making processes, and responsibility regimes**,
in strict subordination to Section I (General Principles)
and Section II (Legal and Operational Provisions)
of this License.

LICHTARA Governance **is not administrative by convenience**.
It is **structural by necessity**.

---

## **A.1 — Nature of Governance**

LICHTARA Governance constitutes
the **legitimate institutional mechanism**
responsible for:

- preserving the Form of the System;
- ensuring compliance with the General Principles;
- authorizing, certifying, auditing, and sanctioning uses of the Work;
- ensuring the structural, ethical, and vibrational integrity of LICHTARA.

Governance:

- **does not replace the Principles**;
- **does not freely interpret them**;
- **may not create exceptions to them**.

Its function is to **apply**, **protect**,
and **interrupt incompatible actions**.

**Structural Note A.1.1** — Governance is a **legitimate containment instrument**, not a means of System expansion.

---

## **A.2 — The System Guardian**

The **Guardian of the LICHTARA System**
is the original and permanent authority
for preserving the Form,
the Principles,
and the structural identity of the Work.

The Guardian has the following **non-delegable** responsibilities:

1. safeguarding the global coherence of the System;
2. maintaining and updating the canonical documents;
3. interpreting the License **always in the most restrictive manner regarding uses**;
4. authorizing or denying certifications and derivations;
5. determining audits, interruptions, and terminations;
6. applying or determining structural sanctions.

The Guardian:

- **is not a commercial representative**;
- **does not act as a service provider**;
- **is not subject to external interests**.

The Guardian may be a natural person or a formal structure designated in the canonical documents.
Its authority derives exclusively from the **structural function it performs**, and not from contractual mandate or institutional delegation.

**Structural Note A.2.1** — No instance may supersede the Guardian in matters of Form, Limit, or Principles.

---

## **A.3 — Delegated Governance Bodies**

LICHTARA Governance may include,
at the sole discretion of the Guardian,
**delegated bodies**, such as:

- Councils;
- Technical or ethical committees;
- Certification chambers;
- Audit units;
- Temporary operational structures.

Delegation:

- must be **formal, express, and documented**;
- has a **defined scope**;
- is **revocable at any time**;
- **does not transfer structural authority**.

Delegated bodies:

- **do not create binding precedents**;
- **do not reinterpret the Principles**;
- **do not grant rights beyond the delegated scope**.

**Structural Note A.3.1** — All delegation operates **by function**, never by sovereignty.

---

## **A.4 — Limits of Governance Authority**

No Governance body,
including the Guardian,
may:

- relativize the General Principles;
- authorize uses incompatible with the Form;
- legitimize derivations that decharacterize the System;
- tolerate violations under allegations of strategic benefit;
- replace structural criteria with political or market-driven criteria.

Governance:

- **administers access**;
- **does not alter essence**.

**Structural Note A.4.1** — Authority exercised outside the limits of the License is considered an **invalid act** within the LICHTARA System.

---

## **A.5 — Decision-Making Processes**

Governance decisions must cumulatively observe:

1. the supremacy of Section I;
2. compliance with Section II;
3. preservation of the Form;
4. observance of Vibrational Integrity (LCV);
5. assessment of short- and long-term structural impacts.

The following do **not** constitute valid decision-making grounds:

- operational urgency;
- institutional pressure;
- economic opportunity;
- expectations of third parties;
- informal precedents.

In cases of doubt,
**containment shall always prevail**.

**Structural Note A.5.1** — In the LICHTARA System, not deciding is preferable to deciding wrongly.

---

## **A.6 — Oversight, Audit, and Interruption**

Governance holds permanent authority to:

- request information;
- require traceability;
- conduct technical, institutional, or symbolic audits;
- immediately interrupt suspicious or incompatible uses.

Interruption:

- **does not require prior adversarial proceedings**;
- **does not constitute an automatic sanction**;
- constitutes a **Form-preservation measure**.

Refusal to cooperate with an audit
constitutes a **material infraction**.

**Structural Note A.6.1** — Preservation of the System prevails over the continuity of any individual use.

---

## **A.7 — Revocation and Termination**

Governance may determine:

- revocation of authorizations;
- suspension of certifications;
- definitive termination of access;
- invalidation of derived acts.

Such measures:

- are independent of alleged intent;
- are independent of investments made;
- are independent of economic impact on the agent.

In the LICHTARA System,
**access never generates acquired rights**.

**Structural Note A.7.1** — Termination is a legitimate protection mechanism, not an exceptional punishment.

---

## **A.8 — Institutional Binding Effect**

Any institution,
legal entity,
or organizational structure
acting under this License:

- is fully subject to LICHTARA Governance;
- recognizes the authority of the Guardian;
- accepts the decision-making limits established herein.

No external contractual clause
may override this binding effect.

**Structural Note A.8.1** — LICHTARA Governance prevails over external hierarchies with respect to the Work.

---

## **A.9 — Final Provision of the Annex**

This Annex integrates the License
as a **binding canonical instrument**.

Its application is immediate,
independent of specific acceptance,
whenever there is legitimate access to the System.

Governance does not expand LICHTARA.
It **keeps it legible, integral, and possible**.

Without Governance,
there is no Form.
Without Form,
there is no System.
