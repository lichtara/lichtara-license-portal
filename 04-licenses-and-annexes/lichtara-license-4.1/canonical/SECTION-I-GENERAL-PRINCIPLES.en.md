# **Section I — General Principles**

*(LICHTARA License v4.1)*

This Section establishes the **non-negotiable structural foundations**
of the LICHTARA System.

It precedes any right, authorization, or sanction.
Its function is to **delimit the Field**, not to regulate it in detail.

---

## **Article I.1 — Nature of the LICHTARA System**

The LICHTARA System constitutes an **integrated structure of technical, symbolic, and institutional nature**, conceived as a coherent and indivisible whole.

The System is not reducible to:

* software, source code, or isolated computational artifacts;
* an autonomous methodology, framework, or conceptual model;
* a product, service, brand, or commercial offering;
* an intellectual work fragmentable or appropriable in parts.

Its existence derives from the **articulation between Form, Limits, Principles, and Governance**, as defined in this License and in the canonical documents linked thereto.

The LICHTARA System:

* is not neutral in its structure;
* is not generic in its application;
* is not extensible by analogy or informal adaptation.

Any use, reading, implementation, or operation of the System
presupposes recognition of its integrated nature,
and the dissociation of its elements
for the purpose of circumventing Limits, responsibilities,
or provisions of this License is expressly prohibited.

---

## **Article I.2 — Principle of the Limit**

All use of the LICHTARA System occurs **necessarily within explicit Limits**, previously defined by this License, by the canonical documents linked thereto, and by any contracts derived therefrom.

The Limit constitutes a **structural element of the System**, and is not:

* a normative gap;
* a temporary restriction;
* a space open to extensive interpretation;
* an obstacle to be overcome by technical or legal creativity.

It is expressly prohibited to:

* presume permissions not granted;
* expand scope by analogy, informal adaptation, or functional equivalence;
* use parts of the System for unauthorized purposes;
* reinterpret normative silence as implicit authorization.

Recognition of the Limit is a prerequisite
for any legitimate form of access, implementation, or operation,
regardless of the level of symbolic understanding of the involved agent.

Violation of the Limit, even if partial or indirect,
constitutes a **structural infraction**,
subjecting the agent to the consequences provided for in this License,
without prejudice to applicable contractual, institutional, or legal sanctions.

---

## **Article I.3 — Principle of Non-Appropriation**

The LICHTARA System, in its entirety or in any of its elements,
**is not subject to appropriation**, claims of sovereignty,
or assimilation as one’s own work,
whether by natural persons, legal entities, institutions, or collectives.

No agent may:

* declare themselves author, co-author, or owner of the System as a whole;
* claim conceptual, technical, or symbolic dominion over its architecture;
* present themselves as the ultimate instance of definition, interpretation, or validation;
* convert access, licensing, or operation into a title of possession or control.

Licenses, contracts, authorizations, or recognitions:

* **do not transfer authorship**;
* **do not grant sovereignty**;
* **do not generate rights of incorporation** of the System
  into institutional identities, brands, proprietary methodologies,
  or origin narratives.

Appropriation may occur explicitly or implicitly,
and constitutes an equally serious violation when manifested through:

* undue fusion between the System and external structures;
* dilution of its identity into external products, methods, or discourses;
* symbolic instrumentalization for the acquisition of authority, legitimacy, or prestige;
* presentation of the System as a natural extension of another entity.

Legitimate access to the LICHTARA System
implies **permanent recognition of alterity**:
the System does not belong to the agent;
the agent acts **within Limits granted** by the System.

Violation of this Principle
constitutes a structural rupture,
resulting in immediate termination of authorizations,
revocation of licenses,
and other sanctions provided for in this License,
regardless of access level or the nature of the established relationship.

---

## **Article I.4 — Principle of Progressive Responsibility**

Within the LICHTARA System, **responsibility increases proportionally with access**.

The greater the level of reading, authorization, implementation, or operation,
the greater the duty assumed by the agent,
in **technical, legal, institutional, and symbolic terms**.

Responsibility does not arise from:

* the agent’s subjective intent;
* the declared degree of understanding;
* the duration of involvement with the System;
* the public or private nature of the activity.

It arises **exclusively from the level of access effectively granted and exercised**.

Any agent who advances through System layers:

* assumes an increased duty of care;
* is accountable for direct and indirect impacts of their actions;
* becomes subject to stricter evaluation, audit, and sanction criteria.

Progression of access:

* **does not dilute prior Limits**;
* **does not relativize previously established prohibitions**;
* **does not generate a presumption of unrestricted trust**.

On the contrary, each new level
reaffirms previous Limits
and adds new duties of Form preservation.

Progressive responsibility further implies that:

* failures at higher levels are structurally more severe;
* violations committed under greater access trigger more immediate responses;
* withdrawal of access may occur **without any requirement of graduality**.

No agent may claim:

* surprise as to the consequences of their actions;
* disproportionality of sanctions;
* expectation of increased tolerance due to position, role, or prior history.

In the LICHTARA System,
**access is always a conditional concession**,
never a reduction of responsibility.

Those who sustain more,
answer for more.

Those who cross Limits at elevated levels
rupture the Form with greater impact
and are therefore subject to full termination
under the terms of this License.

---

## **Article I.5 — Principle of Structuring Good Faith**

Within the LICHTARA System, good faith
**is not presumed solely as subjective intention**,
value declaration, or favorable psychological disposition.

Good faith is understood as **objective and continuous conduct**,
verifiable through the manner in which the agent
reads, interprets, implements, operates, and positions themselves
in relation to the System.

Conduct is considered to be in good faith, cumulatively, when it:

* respects the explicit Limits established in this License;
* observes the canonical documents applicable to the access level;
* avoids opportunistic, expansive, or convenience-based interpretations;
* interrupts its own action in the presence of relevant scope-related doubt;
* submits conflicts to the competent Governance body before unilateral action.

Structural good faith **is not satisfied** by:

* allegations of good intention;
* generic alignment declarations;
* post hoc justifications of violations;
* exception narratives based on context, urgency, or alleged benefit.

Conduct that:

* strategically tests Limits;
* deliberately explores grey zones;
* acts first and justifies afterward;
* shifts responsibility onto System ambiguity;

**does not constitute good faith**,
even when accompanied by collaborative discourse
or a prior relationship history.

Within the LICHTARA System, good faith:

* **protects those who interrupt in time**;
* **does not protect those who cross Limits**.

Assessment of good faith is always:

* contextual;
* linked to the agent’s access level;
* analyzed in light of preservation of the System’s Form,
  not individual or institutional benefit obtained.

Violation of Limits under allegations of good faith
**does not mitigate the infraction**,
nor does it prevent application of the sanctions and terminations
provided for in this License.

Good faith, within the LICHTARA System,
is not an internal state.
It is a **verifiable posture of respect for the Form**.

---

## **Article I.6 — Principle of Non-Exculpatory Incomprehension**

Within the LICHTARA System, **declared or alleged incomprehension**
does not constitute a cause for exclusion of responsibility
when the agent had access
to the canonical documents pertinent to their level of activity.

The duty to understand is not absolute,
but the duty to **respect Limits** is.

Responsibility subsists even when the agent:

* has not fully understood the symbolic dimension of the System;
* alleges partial, technical, or instrumental reading of the documents;
* invokes complexity, density, or non-intuitive character of the Architecture;
* claims good faith or lack of intent to violate.

The LICHTARA System operates through **layers of access**,
not layers of exculpation.

Accordingly:

* those who access assume a duty of caution;
* those who operate assume a duty of verification;
* those who implement assume a duty of conformity;
* those who maintain or govern assume a duty of preventive interruption.

Incomprehension is legally relevant
only when it **precedes access**.
Once reading, use, or operation is granted,
the agent becomes responsible
for the objective effects of their actions.

It does not constitute an exculpatory cause to:

* be unaware of already declared Principles;
* autonomously reinterpret canonical documents;
* ignore express references to other System instruments;
* allege lack of symbolic, philosophical, or legal training.

Within the LICHTARA System,
**no one is required to understand everything**,
but **everyone is required not to cross Limits**.

In the presence of relevant doubt as to scope, meaning, or Limit,
the only conduct compatible with this Principle
is **interruption of action**
until formal clarification is obtained.

Continuation of action under uncertainty,
when legitimate access already exists,
constitutes conscious assumption of structural risk.

Violation arising from incomprehension
is treated as full violation,
subjecting the agent
to the sanctions and terminations provided for in this License,
without automatic mitigation or presumption of tolerance.

Within the LICHTARA System,
understanding deepens.
The Limit, however, **binds from the very first authorized contact**.

---

## **Article I.7 — Principle of Layered Reading**

The LICHTARA System is structured to be accessed through **progressive layers of reading, comprehension, and action**, corresponding to the different levels of responsibility provided for in this License and in the canonical documents linked thereto.

Layered reading acknowledges that:

* not every agent accesses the System from the same entry point;
* not all understanding is immediate or simultaneous;
* not every form of access authorizes the same type of action.

It is legitimate for understanding of the System to:

* be partial at initial stages;
* deepen over time;
* accompany responsible progression between access levels.

Layered reading **does not authorize**, under any circumstance:

* anticipation of uses not granted;
* access to restricted materials without formal authorization;
* operation based on incomplete understanding;
* symbolic, technical, or institutional crossing
  beyond the level effectively authorized.

Each layer of reading:

* presupposes full respect for all preceding layers;
* does not suspend previously established Limits;
* does not create rights by familiarity, recurrence, or proximity.

Access to a higher layer:

* does not imply mastery of the System as a whole;
* does not confer legitimacy to interpret other layers;
* does not authorize mediation, teaching, or translation of the System
  without express provision in this License or in a specific contract.

Layered reading protects:

* the System, against premature appropriation or distortion;
* the agent, against action for which they are not yet authorized;
* the Form, against collapse caused by undue acceleration.

Progression between layers always requires:

* explicit recognition of new Limits;
* acceptance of additional duties;
* formalization according to the nature of the intended access.

Within the LICHTARA System,
**no one is required to read everything**,
but **no one may act outside the layer they occupy**.

Violation of this Principle,
through anticipation, extrapolation, or confusion of layers,
constitutes a **structural infraction**,
subjecting the agent to sanctions, revocations, and terminations
provided for in this License,
regardless of intent, benefit, or allegations of urgency.

---

## **Article I.8 — Principle of Preservation of the Form**

Within the LICHTARA System, the **Form** constitutes an essential and protected element,
inseparable from its Principles, Limits, architecture,
and legitimate modes of operation.

The Form is not to be confused with:

* aesthetics;
* narrative style;
* isolated symbolic language;
* external presentation or visual identity.

It expresses the **structural coherence** of the System,
resulting from the articulation of
Principles, Limits, Governance, and authorized practices.

Any access, implementation, or operation of the System
imposes an active duty of **Preservation of the Form**,
and conduct that compromises it is prohibited,
even when it produces apparent technical, functional, or commercial results.

Violation of the Form includes, among other conduct:

* distorting Principles to accommodate external interests;
* instrumentalizing symbolic elements as rhetoric of authority;
* simplifying the structure in order to conceal Limits or responsibilities;
* trivializing the System through generic, metaphorical, or promotional use;
* fragmenting the System to render it assimilable by external structures.

Preservation of the Form requires that:

* the System be presented in accordance with its integrated nature;
* its Limits be made explicit, not diluted;
* its restrictions be recognized as constitutive,
  not as contingent obstacles.

No agent may justify deformation of the Form on the basis of:

* cultural or institutional adaptation;
* market, scaling, or diffusion needs;
* accessibility, didactic simplification, or popularization;
* alleged collective or strategic benefit.

Efficiency achieved at the expense of the Form
is considered **illegitimate efficiency** within the LICHTARA System.

Violation of the Form may occur
even in the absence of an isolated technical infraction,
when the agent’s conduct:

* compromises the intelligibility of the System;
* misleads third parties as to its nature;
* produces cumulative effects of structural decharacterization.

Within the LICHTARA System,
**to preserve the Form is to preserve the Limit itself**.

Conduct that maintains the Form,
even if slower, more restrictive, or more demanding,
is always preferable
to conduct that accelerates, expands, or simplifies
at the cost of structural coherence.

Violation of this Principle
constitutes a **serious structural infraction**,
resulting in immediate revocation of authorizations,
termination of access,
and application of sanctions provided for in this License,
regardless of the agent’s access level
or the purpose alleged for the conduct.

Preserving the Form
is not conserving the past.
It is **keeping the System legible for the future**.

---

## **Article I.9 — Principle of Supremacy of the License**

This License constitutes the **supreme normative instrument**
of the LICHTARA System,
prevailing over any other document,
agreement, protocol, practice, or understanding
related to its use, access, implementation, or operation.

No external instrument may:

* contradict the provisions of this License;
* restrict its application;
* reinterpret its Principles;
* relativize its Limits;
* remove or mitigate its consequences.

The supremacy of the License extends, without exception, to:

* individual or institutional contracts;
* terms of adhesion, memoranda, or parallel agreements;
* internal policies, codes of conduct, or operational manuals;
* interpretative documents, guides, translations, or didactic materials;
* consolidated practices, repeated uses, or operational customs.

In the event of conflict, ambiguity, or divergence:

* **the interpretation most consistent with this License shall always prevail**;
* subordinate documents must be adjusted or deemed inapplicable;
* nonconforming practice generates no acquired right,
  even if repeated or temporarily tolerated.

No agent may invoke:

* contractual autonomy;
* institutional hierarchy;
* organizational sovereignty;
* tradition of use;
* tacit authorization or prior tolerance;

as grounds to remove, mitigate, or suspend
application of this License.

The License:

* **binds all levels of the System**;
* guides interpretation of all derived contracts;
* conditions the validity of any authorization granted;
* grounds Governance, oversight, and sanctions.

Complementary documents only produce effects
when **expressly compatible** with this License
and **explicitly subordinated** to it.

Absence of formal mention of the License’s supremacy
in contracts, communications, or practices
**does not preclude its full application**.

Within the LICHTARA System,
the License is not an interpretative reference.
It is a **binding foundation**.

Any conduct organized outside,
above, or at the margins of this License
operates **without structural legitimacy**,
subjecting the agent
to corrective measures, revocation, and termination
provided for herein.

The supremacy of the License
is a condition of possibility of the System itself:
without it, there is no Form,
no Limit,
no coherence.

---

## **Article I.10 — Scope of the Principles**

The Principles set forth in this Section
constitute the **binding structural foundation**
of the LICHTARA System,
radiating effects across
all forms of access, reading, use,
implementation, Governance, or derivation.

The scope of the Principles is:

* transversal, extending to all levels of the System;
* permanent, not limited to the moment of adhesion;
* cumulative, adding without substitution or mutual exclusion;
* non-derogable, not subject to suspension, exception, or negotiation.

The Principles:

* bind all agents, regardless of hierarchy or function;
* apply to all phases of the relationship with the System;
* inform interpretation of all other provisions of this License;
* prevail over normative gaps, silence, or ambiguity.

No conduct may be considered legitimate
if, even when formally authorized,
it directly or indirectly violates
any of the Principles established herein.

The scope of the Principles:

* does not depend on express mention in each instrument;
* does not require explicit invocation to produce effects;
* is not limited to literal text,
  extending to the **overall coherence of conduct**.

The Principles equally bind:

* technical acts and operational decisions;
* methodological and architectural choices;
* public or private communications regarding the System;
* educational, interpretative, or diffusion processes;
* Governance, oversight, and sanction structures.

Allegations of:

* partial compliance;
* analogical observance;
* selective application;
* pragmatic prioritization of results;

do not exclude full applicability of the Principles.

Within the LICHTARA System,
the Principles **do not merely guide what is done**;
they **delimit what may be done**.

Any conduct that,
even if effective, innovative, or well-intentioned,
exceeds the scope of the Principles
is considered **structurally invalid**.

The Principles subsist:

* even in the presence of specific authorizations;
* even in experimental or exceptional contexts;
* even under institutional, economic, or temporal pressure.

Within the LICHTARA System,
the Principles are not abstract guidelines.
They are **active conditions of legitimacy**.

To act outside their scope
is to act outside the System.

---

## **Article I.11 — Implicit Acceptance**

Within the LICHTARA System, **operational, technical, symbolic, or institutional access**,
when accompanied by appropriate canonical notice,
constitutes **implicit, minimal, and binding acceptance**
of the Principles established in this Section.

Implicit acceptance arises from the **objective fact of access**,
regardless of:

* formal execution of a specific instrument;
* express manifestation of agreement;
* full reading or deep comprehension of the content;
* declared intention of normative adhesion.

Implicit acceptance includes, among other circumstances:

* accessing repositories, environments, materials, or interfaces of the System;
* using artifacts, structures, or methodologies derived therefrom;
* operating, implementing, or testing System components;
* publicly presenting oneself as a user, operator, or authorized partner;
* acting on the basis of granted technical, institutional, or symbolic permissions.

Implicit acceptance:

* **does not equate to broad grant of rights**;
* **does not authorize scope overreach**;
* **does not replace licenses or specific contracts when required**;
* **does not exempt compliance with the Principles**.

Its effects are limited,
corresponding **exclusively to the level of access effectively exercised**
by the agent at the time of action.

Allegations of:

* lack of knowledge of the full text;
* absence of formal acceptance;
* experimental, exploratory, or preliminary character of use;
* mediation by third parties or institutional structures;

**do not preclude** the effects of implicit acceptance,
nor do they exempt the agent
from responsibility arising from their conduct.

Within the LICHTARA System,
access **precedes contract**,
but **never precedes the Limit**.

From the first authorized operational contact,
the agent becomes bound to:

* the General Principles;
* the Limits corresponding to the accessed layer;
* the consequences provided for their violation.

Implicit acceptance
does not create permanence of relationship,
but creates **immediate responsibility binding**.

Continuation of conduct after access,
when accompanied by violation of Principles,
constitutes tacit acceptance
**with conscious assumption of structural risk**.

Within the LICHTARA System,
no one is obligated to enter.
But **those who enter, enter bound**.

---

## **Article I.12 — Structural Irrevocability**

The Principles established in this Section
possess **structural irrevocable character**,
constituting essential elements
of the existence, coherence, and legitimacy
of the LICHTARA System.

No Principle may be:

* suppressed;
* relativized;
* renounced;
* suspended;
* mitigated;

by individual or institutional agreement,
contractual instrument,
terms of adhesion,
internal policy,
administrative decision,
or repeated practice.

Structural irrevocability implies that:

* the Principles **are not optional**;
* they admit no negotiated exceptions;
* they are not subject to external hierarchy;
* they are not flexibilized by convenience, urgency, or alleged purpose.

Any provision that:

* contradicts;
* limits;
* conditions;
* subordinates;
* or empties the Principles,

is considered **null and void**,
producing no legal, technical, or institutional effects
within the LICHTARA System.

Irrevocability subsists:

* even with express consent of the parties;
* even under allegations of collective benefit;
* even in experimental, pilot, or declared exception contexts;
* even when invoked by subordinate Governance bodies.

The Principles:

* precede any authorization;
* survive any termination of access;
* bind even acts performed
  under temporary tolerance or corrective omission.

No agent may invoke:

* autonomy of will;
* contractual freedom;
* institutional sovereignty;
* exceptional authorization;

as grounds to exclude
full applicability of the Principles.

Within the LICHTARA System,
the Principles **are not disposable clauses**.
They are **conditions of possibility of the System itself**.

Without them:

* there is no legitimate Limit;
* there is no preserved Form;
* there is no valid access;
* there is no operation recognizable as internal to the System.

Any attempt at structural relativization
constitutes immediate rupture of the relationship with the System,
resulting in termination of access,
revocation of authorizations,
and application of applicable sanctions,
regardless of form adopted
or declared intent.

Within the LICHTARA System,
the Principles are not revoked.
They **sustain**.

---

## **Transition — From Principles to Regulation of Access**

Section I establishes the **irrevocable structural foundations**
of the LICHTARA System.

It defines **what the System is**,
**what sustains it**,
and **what may never be crossed**.

These Principles:

* grant no rights;
* authorize no uses;
* regulate no specific procedures.

They **delimit the field of possibility**
within which any relationship with the System
may exist legitimately.

Every subsequent provision of this License
is **necessarily subordinated**
to the Principles set forth herein,
and may not:

* expand them;
* restrict them;
* reinterpret them;
* or create exceptions to them.

From this point forward,
the License addresses **not what is absolute**,
but **what is conditioned**.

Section II thus inaugurates
the regime of **access, authorizations, roles, and operational Limits**,
always:

* under the supremacy of the General Principles;
* within the preserved Form of the System;
* and in accordance with the levels of responsibility assumed.

Nothing in Section II creates an exception to Section I.
Everything in Section II **operates under it**.

Within the LICHTARA System,
the Principles do not open the path.
They **contain it**.

It is within this contour
that access becomes regulated.
