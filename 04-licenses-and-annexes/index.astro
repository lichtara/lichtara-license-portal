<section>
  <p>
    The Lichtara License is not an isolated legal artifact.
    It is the <strong>juridical articulation of a living architecture</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here, legal form does not close the System —
    it allows the System to meet the world without losing itself.
  </p>

  <h2>What this axis contains</h2>

<section>
  <h2>From law to continuity</h2>

  <p>
    These documents ensure that the System can interact with
    legal, academic, and institutional environments
    without sacrificing <em>authorship continuity</em>
    or the integrity of its source-work.
  </p>

  <p>
    Law, here, is not a constraint.
    It is a <strong>structure of care across time</strong>.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Canonical coherence</h2>

  <p>
    All materials in this axis are versioned, traceable,
    and aligned with the living governance of the Lichtara System.
  </p>

  <p>
    This guarantees that openness never becomes fragmentation,
    and legitimacy never dissolves into ambiguity.
