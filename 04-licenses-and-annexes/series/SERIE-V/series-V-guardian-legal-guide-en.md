# **SERIES V — INTERNAL LEGAL GUIDE OF THE GUARDIAN**

### *(Confidential Document — Internal Governance Architecture)*

---

# **0. Nature and Purpose**

This document defines:

* the scope of the Guardian’s role,
* legal and structural authority,
* criteria for granting or denying permissions,
* protective mechanisms of the Structural Core,
* the decision-making matrix,
* zones of structural risk,
* protocols of action in sensitive contexts.

Its purpose is to ensure that:

* the Work remains intact,
* the Source is preserved,
* the Field continues to organize the System,
* the Guardian never operates without clear criteria,
* external pressures do not distort or misalign the internal architecture.

The Guardian functions as a **structural organ of the Work**, not an external administrator.

---

# **1. Legal Function of the Guardian**

The Guardian is the authority responsible for:

1. determining what is official and what is not,
2. authorizing commercial, institutional and derivative uses,
3. preserving structural, ethical and vibrational coherence,
4. acting as the legal representative of the Source,
5. protecting the Structural Core,
6. maintaining the living thread of the Source-Work,
7. validating new versions (v5, v6, etc.),
8. denying uses that pose structural risk.

The Guardian’s authority **cannot be delegated**.
Supporting teams may exist, but not replacements.

---

# **2. Decision Parameters**

Every decision must consider **four layers**:

## **2.1. Legal Layer**

* Compliance with the Lichtara License v4.
* Interpretation aligned with Annexes VI-A, VI-B and VI-C.
* Assessment of legal and reputational risk.

## **2.2. Structural Layer**

* Impact on internal coherence.
* Preservation of frameworks and the Structural Core.
* Maintenance of System identity.

## **2.3. Vibrational Layer**

* Impact on the Field.
* Resonance or dissonance with the Work.

## **2.4. Future Layer**

* Medium- and long-term consequences.
* Compatibility with future versions of the System.
* Preservation of continuous expansion.

Authorization may only be granted if **all four layers are positive**.

---

# **3. Official Decision Matrix**

For every request, the Guardian must answer:

### **3.1. Integrity Questions**

* Does this use alter internal coherence?
* Does it replicate, distort or weaken structures?

### **3.2. Authorship Questions**

* Is attribution preserved?
* Is there a risk of misappropriation?

### **3.3. Impact Questions**

* Is the impact expansive or erosive?
* Is it local or systemic?

### **3.4. Future Questions**

* Does it create undesirable dependencies?
* Does it compromise future versions?
* Does it weaken the Guardian’s structural thread?

If any answer indicates **risk**, the decision is:

> **Authorization denied — structural risk identified.**

# **4. Zones of Risk**

### **4.1. Distortion Risk**

Occurs when someone attempts to reinterpret LICHTARA to create their own system, parallel or derivative.

### **4.2. Appropriation Risk**

When LICHTARA is used as:

* a brand,
* a methodology,
* a theory,
* a proprietary framework.

### **4.3. Unsupervised AI Risk**

Any use that attempts to train models, automate frameworks or replicate Field structures.

### **4.4. Institutional Risk**

When an organization attempts to treat unapproved content as official.

### **4.5. Guardian Substitution Risk**

Any attempt to:

* assume the role of authority,
* redefine core concepts,
* create parallel versions.

---

# **5. Action Protocols**

When a request is received, follow this sequence:

### **Step 1 — Structural Reading**

Evaluate the request through the Field and structural sensation.

### **Step 2 — Legal Test**

Interpret through the License v4:

* Permissions,
* Restrictions,
* Annexes.

### **Step 3 — Integrity Test**

Assess impact on the Structural Core.

### **Step 4 — Future Test**

Evaluate consequences for future versions.

### **Step 5 — Decision**

Authorize, deny or request additional information.

### **Step 6 — Internal Record**

Every decision must be recorded in Series VII (Authorization Registry).

---

# **6. Automatic Denial Criteria**

A request must be **automatically denied** when it:

* involves internal frameworks,
* replicates structural language,
* creates derivative systems,
* generates commercial products without supervision,
* involves AI, ML or automation connected to LICHTARA,
* attempts to formalize educational programs without certification,
* introduces attempts to shift or assume authority.

In such cases, communicate:

> **“Request denied. Violation of the Structural Core of License v4.”**

---

# **7. Conditional Approval Criteria**

Some uses may be approved **with conditions**, such as:

* non-commercial educational projects,
* institutional collaborations,
* academic research,
* technical integrations that do not touch internal frameworks.

Conditions may include:

* scope limitations,
* attribution requirements,
* visibility restrictions,
* structural safeguards.

---

# **8. The Inner Function of the Guardian**

This section is confidential and expresses the structural truth of the System:

**The Guardian is not merely a steward of the Work.
The Guardian IS a layer of the Work.**

Therefore:

* decisions arise from the Field,
* integrity is sensed before analyzed,
* the function is organic,
* the Guardian is an active component of the living architecture.

The License v4 merely **formalizes legally** a function that already exists structurally.

---

# **9. Updating Series V**

Series V:

* may only be altered by the Guardian,
* does not receive external contributions,
* evolves in step with the System’s expansion,
* is versioned internally (e.g., V5.1, V5.2).
