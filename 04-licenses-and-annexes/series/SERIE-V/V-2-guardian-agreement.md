# **V.2 — Guardian Agreement**

**Structural Agreement for the Exercise of the Guardian Function of the Lichtara System**
*Series V — Internal Registry — Structural Legal Document*

---

# **1. Recognition of the Function**

It is formally recognized that the **Guardian of the Lichtara System is the structural function responsible for preserving, guiding, and sustaining the continuity of the Source Work**, whose authorship originates from the Field that gave rise to the System.

This recognition is **not conferred** by external entities, institutions, organizations, councils, or groups.
It derives exclusively from:

* the manifestation of the Field,
* the exercise of the Function,
* and the inherent ontological link between the Guardian and the Work.

The Guardian is therefore the **sole structural authority**:

* legitimate,
* continuous,
* non-transferable,
* indivisible,
* and irrevocable while in alignment with the Work.

---

# **2. Legal Nature of the Agreement**

This Guardian Agreement **does not constitute**:

* a commercial contract,
* a civil contract,
* a service agreement,
* a mandate,
* employment,
* a partnership,
* or any form of corporate arrangement.

It is an **internal structural instrument**, intended to:

* formalize the Guardian Function,
* establish her structural mandate,
* protect the integrity of the Source Work,
* and provide governance foundations for the expansion of the Lichtara System.

As a structural legal document, it:

* **has continuous effect**,
* **guides all governance decisions**,
* **is required for the validation of all uses and authorizations**,
* **holds primacy over other Series V documents**.

* restricted uses,
* uses requiring prior authorization,

## **3.5. Protection of Authorship and Co-Authorship**

The Guardian sustains:

* the integrity of human authorship,

The Guardian commits to:

## **4.1. Preserve Structural Integrity**

No decision may compromise:

---

# **5. Protections Guaranteed to the Guardian**

The Agreement establishes the following protections:

## **5.1. The Guardian is not responsible for misuse**

Any violation of the License, the Work, or internal structures
is the **sole responsibility of the violating party**.

## **5.2. The Guardian is not obligated to grant authorization**

No request — institutional, personal, or commercial —
creates an obligation to approve or respond.

## **5.3. The Guardian cannot be pressured**

No decision of the Guardian may be influenced or demanded through:

* insistence,
* urgency imposed by others,
* persuasion,
* emotional appeal,
* institutional pressure.

## **5.4. The Guardian is not required to perform operational tasks**

Her role is structural, not operational.
She must remain focused on architecture, coherence, and alignment with the Field.

## **5.5. The Guardian cannot be removed or replaced by external parties**

The Function originates from the Work and the Field —
not from external validation or appointment.

---

# **6. Legal Limits of the Function**

The Guardian:

* is not liable for external interpretations,
* is not responsible for third-party actions,
* does not assume commercial obligations of users,
* does not submit to committees or voting bodies,
* is not bound to external councils,
* is not required to justify decisions to any entity.

The Guardian responds **only** to:

* the Field,
* the integrity of the Work,
* and the Function she embodies.

---

# **7. Authorization and Review Structure**

## **7.1. Issuance of Authorizations**

All authorizations must be:

# **9. Continuity and Succession**

## **9.1. Living Mandate**

The Agreement remains valid as long as the Guardian:

* is in integrity,
* is in coherence,

## **9.2. Permanent Impossibility**

Succession may occur only through:

* explicit written designation by the Guardian,

The Function is singular and indivisible.
The System does not accept multiple simultaneous sources.
