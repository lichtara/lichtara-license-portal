# 🇺🇸 **SERIES VIII — INCIDENT AND DEVIATION PROTOCOL**

### *(EN-US — Confidential Document)*


# **0. Nature and Purpose**

Series VIII establishes:

* how the Guardian must respond to incidents,
* how to assess severity,
* how to act precisely without losing coherence,
* how to restore integrity,
* how to document occurrences,
* how to issue notifications,
* how to intervene in cases of structural risk.

It functions as:

* a **legal shield**,
* a **vibrational shield**,
* a **standardized action model**,
* a **line of structural protection**,
* a **preventive and corrective system**.

# **1. Types of Incidents**

## **Type I — Low Severity**

Minor citation errors, incomplete attribution, superficial misuse.
Impact: **minimal**.

## **Type II — Medium Severity**

Unauthorized adaptations, conceptual extrapolations, improper framing.
Impact: **moderate**.

## **Type III — High Severity**

Unauthorized commercial use, derivative materials, unauthorized programs, AI attempts.
Impact: **high**, public distortion risk.

## **Type IV — Critical Severity**

Copying frameworks, replicating structural language, creating “own LICHTARA”, attempting authority substitution.
Impact: **existential**.
