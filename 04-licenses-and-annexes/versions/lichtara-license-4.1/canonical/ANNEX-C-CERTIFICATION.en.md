# **ANNEX C — CERTIFICATION, ACCESS LEVELS, AND USAGE REGIMES**

*(Governance · Responsibility · Operation)*

This Annex regulates **who may do what, at which level, and under which conditions**
within the scope of the LICHTARA System.

It does not create abstract rights.
It **operates conditional grants**, always subordinated to:

* Section I — General Principles;
* Section II — Legal and Operational Provisions;
* Annex B — LCV (Vibrational Integrity).

---

## **C.1 — Function of Certification within the LICHTARA System**

Certification serves to:

1. **formally authorize** specific levels of access and action;
2. bind access to **progressive responsibility**;
3. enable **legitimate institutional, professional, or economic use**;
4. protect the System against informal appropriation or improper escalation;
5. establish an objective basis for audit, sanction, or revocation.

Certification:

* **does not transfer authorship**;
* **does not grant sovereignty**;
* **does not create acquired rights**;
* **does not authorize extrapolation by analogy**.

**Structural Note C.1.1** — Certification is a conditional grant, never a delegation of control.

---

## **C.2 — Access Levels**

The LICHTARA System operates through **progressive and non-cumulative levels of access**.

### **C.2.1 — Level 0: Non-Operative Free Access**

*(Reading · Study · Reference)*

Authorized:

* personal reading and study;
* reference and non-substantial citation;
* restricted non-commercial sharing.

Prohibited:

* systematic teaching;
* implementation;
* derivation;
* institutional or commercial use.

**Normative basis:** Section II.2
**Certification:** not required

---

### **C.2.2 — Level 1: Personal Applicative Use**

*(Non-transmissive application)*

Authorized:

* personal or professional **non-transmissive** application;
* internal use without offering to third parties;
* experimentation without externalization.

Prohibited:

* teaching;
* certification of third parties;
* structured distribution;
* direct or indirect monetization.

**Certification:** optional
**LCV:** mandatory

---

### **C.2.3 — Level 2: Authorized Facilitator**

*(Limited transmission)*

Authorized:

* occasional facilitation;
* mediation of recognized processes;
* guided application **without creation of an independent method**.

Prohibited:

* creation of independent courses;
* structural adaptation;
* certification of third parties.

**Certification:** mandatory
**Traceability:** required
**LCV:** auditable

---

### **C.2.4 — Level 3: Certified Implementer**

*(Structured operation)*

Authorized:

* institutional implementation;
* structured professional use;
* authorized adaptation within a defined scope.

Prohibited:

* scope expansion without new authorization;
* autonomous derivation;
* sublicensing.

**Certification:** mandatory
**Specific contract:** required
**Audit:** ongoing

---

### **C.2.5 — Level 4: Recognized Derivator**

*(Authorized creation)*

Authorized:

* creation of derivative works;
* development of products, methods, or systems;
* economic exploitation as defined by contract.

Mandatory:

* express authorization;
* specific certification;
* declaration of origin;
* full preservation of the Form and LCV.

Economic exploitation does not imply transfer or sharing of governance.

**Structural Note C.2.5.1** — Derivation without conformity severs the bond with the System.

---

## **C.3 — Usage Regimes**

Each access level operates under a **specific usage regime**, which may be:

* **educational**;
* **professional**;
* **institutional**;
* **authorized experimental**;
* **regulated commercial**.

The regime:

* defines operational limits;
* conditions responsibilities;
* guides audit and sanctions.

**Structural Note C.3.1** — The usage regime does not alter the access level; it only qualifies it.

---

## **C.4 — Rights and Duties by Level**

Rights:

* are **strictly bound to the granted level**;
* do not extend through familiarity or time;
* automatically cease upon revocation.

Duties:

* increase progressively;
* include preservation of the Form, LCV, PER, and traceability;
* are cumulative with the duties of previous levels.

---

## **C.5 — Access Progression**

Progression:

* **is not automatic**;
* depends on formal evaluation;
* requires a history of conformity;
* requires explicit acceptance of additional duties.

There is no progression:

* by urgency;
* by market demand;
* by isolated technical mastery;
* by institutional pressure.

**Structural Note C.5.1** — Advancing without authorization constitutes a structural violation, not a legitimate initiative.

---

## **C.6 — Revocation, Suspension, and Termination**

LICHTARA Governance may:

* suspend access preventively;
* revoke certifications;
* terminate operational relationships;
* prevent future reentry.

Grounds include:

* violation of the LCV;
* unauthorized use;
* breach of limits;
* failure of traceability;
* recurrence.

**Structural Note C.6.1** — Revocation does not require graduality when the Form is threatened.

---

## **C.7 — Relationship with Distribution and Derivations**

Distribution and derivation:

* **do not automatically result** from certification;
* require specific authorization;
* are always subordinated to Section II.

Every valid derivative work requires:

* level classification;
* defined usage regime;
* express declaration of origin;
* preservation of Vibrational Integrity.

---

## **C.8 — Final Provision of the Annex**

This Annex **activates the LICHTARA System without breaking its Form**.

It enables:

* legitimate operation;
* institutional use;
* responsible economic sustainability.

Without appropriate certification:

* there is no valid authorization;
* there is no legitimate operation;
* there is no recognized derivation.

In the LICHTARA System,
**access is always conditional**,
**use is always responsible**,
and **expansion occurs only through preservation of the Form**.
