# **ANNEX B — LCV (VIBRATIONAL COHERENCE LICENSE)**

**Vibrational Integrity of the LICHTARA System**

*(Form · Coherence · Verifiability · Limit)*

This Annex establishes the **LCV — Vibrational Coherence License**
as a **verifiable structural criterion**
for assessing the legitimacy of
uses, implementations, derivations, and operations
related to the LICHTARA System.

The LCV **is not a metaphor**, **not a belief**, and **not a subjective judgment**.
It translates, into observable parameters,
the preservation of the **living Form of the System**.

---

## **B.1 — Function of the LCV**

The LCV serves to:

1. translate the notion of “field” into a **technical-operational criterion**;
2. enable **objective assessment of structural and ethical coherence**;
3. prevent distortions before they become irreversible;
4. ground decisions of **audit, interruption, and sanction**;
5. protect the System against symbolic trivialization or opportunistic exploitation.

The LCV **does not create new rights**.
It **qualifies the legitimacy of existing use**.

**Structural Note B.1.1** — Where there is no verifiable coherence, there is no legitimate use of the System.

---

## **B.2 — Operational Definition of Vibrational Integrity**

**Vibrational Integrity** is considered preserved
when an action related to the LICHTARA System:

* maintains **coherence between Form, Principle, and application**;
* respects the **explicit limits** of the License;
* does not instrumentalize symbolic elements as empty rhetoric;
* does not produce cumulative effects of structural decharacterization;
* remains legible as an action **internal to the System**, rather than external appropriation.

Vibrational Integrity is a **condition of legitimacy**, not of effectiveness.

**Structural Note B.2.1** — Functional results do not compensate for structural incoherence.

---

## **B.3 — Minimum Coherence Parameters (MCP)**

LCV assessment observes, cumulatively, the following minimum parameters:

### **B.3.1 — Coherence of Form**

The action:

* preserves the conceptual architecture of the System;
* does not simplify limits to facilitate adoption;
* does not fragment essential elements.

### **B.3.2 — Coherence of Limit**

The action:

* respects the authorized scope;
* does not anticipate ungranted layers;
* does not deliberately operate in grey zones.

### **B.3.3 — Ethical Coherence (PER)**

The action:

* does not instrumentalize the System for power, authority, or prestige;
* does not mislead third parties regarding the nature of LICHTARA;
* interrupts itself in the presence of relevant doubt.

### **B.3.4 — Coherence of Origin**

The action:

* explicitly acknowledges LICHTARA origin;
* does not dilute authorship;
* does not conceal structural dependence on the System.

### **B.3.5 — Coherence of Effect**

The action:

* does not generate implicit derivations;
* does not create illegitimate expectations in third parties;
* does not expand the System through informal repeated use.

**Structural Note B.3.1** — The absence of any parameter invalidates the LCV, even if all others are present.

---

## **B.4 — Conducts that Preserve Vibrational Integrity**

Among others, the following preserve LCV:

* interrupting action in the presence of uncertainty;
* formally requesting guidance from Governance;
* refusing uses that suggest disproportionate external benefit;
* maintaining clear documentation of limits and authorizations;
* accepting containment even when technical advancement is possible.

**Structural Note B.4.1** — Conscious containment is a sign of integrity, not limitation.

---

## **B.5 — Conducts that Violate Vibrational Integrity**

The following violate LCV, regardless of intent:

* using symbolic language to mask scope overreach;
* transforming the System into motivational, therapeutic, or commercial narrative;
* operating “as if” nonexistent authorization were granted;
* presenting external results as validation of the System;
* persisting in action after nonconformity has been signaled.

Violation may be **progressive and cumulative**.

**Structural Note B.5.1** — LCV may be broken through accumulation of small distortions.

---

## **B.6 — Relationship between LCV, Form, PER, and Sanctions**

The LCV:

* operationalizes the **Principle of Preservation of the Form** (Section I);
* concretizes the **PER** in practical assessment;
* grounds audits provided for in Section II;
* guides the proportionality of sanctions.

Breach of LCV:

* often precedes formal legal infraction;
* authorizes **preventive interruption**;
* may justify immediate revocation of access.

**Structural Note B.6.1** — Sanction does not arise from the LCV; it arises from the incoherent action revealed by it.

---

## **B.7 — Limits of the LCV (What the LCV Is Not)**

The LCV **is not**:

* emotional, spiritual, or psychological evaluation of the agent;
* judgment of subjective intent;
* assessment of belief, faith, or personal alignment;
* tool for symbolic hierarchy among users;
* instrument of ideological exclusion.

The LCV **is**:

* a structural criterion;
* an objective coherence parameter;
* a mechanism for System preservation.

**Structural Note B.7.1** — The LCV protects the System; it does not judge people.

---

## **B.8 — Verification, Audit, and Contestation**

LCV verification may occur through:

* formal audit;
* documentary analysis;
* assessment of operational effects;
* identification of reiterated incoherence.

The agent may:

* submit compliance documentation;
* clarify operational context;
* demonstrate timely voluntary interruption.

Lack of cooperation **aggravates the violation**.

Contestation does not automatically suspend preventive interruption measures.

**Structural Note B.8.1** — Transparency is a minimum condition for preservation of LCV.

---

## **B.9 — Final Provision of the Annex**

The LCV integrates this License
as a **technical instrument for verification of legitimacy**.

Without Vibrational Integrity:

* there is no preserved Form;
* there is no legitimate use;
* there is no derivation recognizable as internal to the System.

The LCV does not expand LICHTARA.
It **prevents it from being lost**.

Where coherence breaks,
the System ceases to be present,
even if the name remains.
