# **TERMINOLOGY — CANONICAL ENGLISH TERMS**

*(LICHTARA License v4.1)*

This document establishes the **canonical English terminology**
to be used throughout the LICHTARA License v4.1
and all its associated canonical documents, annexes, manuals, mappings,
and institutional materials.

Its purpose is to ensure:

* semantic coherence between Portuguese (PT) and English (EN);
* preservation of the ontological Form of the System;
* legal and institutional consistency in international contexts;
* protection against reductive, metaphorical, or instrumental translations.

Terminology defined herein is considered **structurally binding**
for all English-language versions of LICHTARA documents.

| **Instância**               | **Body** (governance context) / **Instance** (generic) | “Body” reserved for governance and institutional roles.                          |

## 📌 Capitalization Rules (Structural Rule)

* **Ontological and structural terms** of the LICHTARA System
  → **Capitalized**
  *(e.g., Form, System, Principles, Guardian, License, Work)*

* **Operational, procedural, or generic terms**
  → lowercase, unless sentence-initial or legally required.

Capitalization is not stylistic.
It reflects **ontological and normative distinction**.

---

## ⚖️ Interpretative Rule

In case of doubt, ambiguity, or conflict:

* the **Portuguese (PT) version** remains the semantic reference;
* the English (EN) version must preserve **Form, scope, and limits**,
  even if this requires departing from idiomatic convenience.

No translation may:

* simplify ontological terms for readability;
* replace canonical terms with functional equivalents;
* introduce metaphors, analogies, or culturally adaptive language.

Terminology is considered **part of the Form**.

## 🌱 Final Note

> *This document constitutes a **canonical auxiliary instrument** of the LICHTARA License v4.1.*

This terminology does not exist to standardize language usage.
It exists to **preserve the coherence, legibility, and integrity**
of a living System across languages.

Where terminology is altered,
Form is altered.

Where Form is altered,
the System ceases to be present.
