Title: Introduction — How to Read a Living System

Subtitle: The Lichtara System is not a repository of documents.
It is a structure of continuity.

Body:

This portal does not present isolated texts.
It presents a living architecture of authorship, governance, ethics, licenses and institutional acts.

Each section is part of a continuous circuit:

Living Authorship → Living Governance → Ethics & Co-authorship → Licenses → Instruments & Acts → back to Authorship

This cycle is not navigational convenience.
It is how the System preserves identity while allowing evolution.
