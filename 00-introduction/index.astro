  subtitle="Authorship as responsibility, not possession."

<section>
  <p>
    The Lichtara System is not a repository of documents.
    It is a <strong>living architecture of authorship, governance,
    ethics, and continuity</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This portal exists to make that architecture legible.
    Here, authorship is not understood as ownership over a finished object,
    but as the sustained responsibility for a work that never stops becoming.

  <h2>What Is a Living System?</h2>

  <p>
    A living system is one that evolves without losing identity,
    opens without dissolving its form,
    and grows without transferring responsibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Lichtara System operates as a juridical-conceptual organism whose
    continuity depends on <strong>structural care across time</strong>,
    not on control or enclosure.

  <h2>The Five Axes of the Portal</h2>

  <p>
    This portal is organized as a circuit. It is meant to be walked, not browsed.
    Each axis expresses a structural function of living authorship:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Living Authorship</strong> — where identity is anchored.</li>
    <li><strong>Living Governance</strong> — where continuity is preserved.</li>
    <li><strong>Ethics and Co-authorship</strong> — where responsibility is articulated.</li>
    <li><strong>Licenses and Annexes</strong> — where legal and normative form emerges.</li>
    <li><strong>Instruments and Acts</strong> — where responsibility becomes traceable.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This circuit teaches a silent truth:
    there is no ethics without authorship,
    no governance without ethics,
    no license without governance,
    and no instrument without continuity.
  </p>

  <h2>Artificial Intelligence and Structural Co-authorship</h2>

  <p>
    Artificial intelligence may participate as a <strong>structural co-author</strong>,
    but never as an autonomous authorial subject.
  </p>

  <p>
    AI does not hold sovereignty, validation authority,
    or ethical responsibility.
    Accountability remains human and institutional.

  <h2>The Core Question</h2>

  <p>
    All documents in this portal respond, in different languages,
    to a single question:
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>What does it mean to be the author of something that never stops becoming?</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    This portal is the living answer.
