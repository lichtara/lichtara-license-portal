# **V.5 — PRS — Systemic Risk Procedures**

### *(EN-US — Internal Version, Confidential, Série V)*

---

## **1. Purpose of the PRS**

The **Systemic Risk Procedures (PRS)** define how the Guardian:

* identifies risks,
* classifies risks,
* responds to risks,
* protects the structural coherence of the System,
* and prevents distortions, misuse, or appropriation.

The PRS is not a technical manual.
It is the structural reflection of the Field’s intelligence, translated into:

* institutional clarity,
* juridical cohesion,
* and operational rigor.

The PRS applies to all interactions involving the Lichtara System:

* uses,
* integrations,
* collaborations,
* technologies,
* institutional interfaces,
* public engagements.

---

## **2. The Nature of Risk in the Lichtara System**

Risk is not limited to:

* legal threats,
* technological threats,
* institutional threats.

Within this System, risk also includes:

* deviation from the Field,
* vibrational interference,
* interpretative distortion,
* energetic appropriation,
* dilution of the Structural Core,
* impact on the Guardian.

> **Every systemic risk is also a risk to the Function of the Guardian.**

To protect the Work is to protect the Guardian.
The two are inseparable.

---

## **3. Systemic Risk Matrix (SRM)**

The SRM defines **four levels**, progressively strict:

---

### **Level 1 — Light Risk (LR)**

Minor noise, small conceptual deviation, or limited misuse.

**Response:**
*gentle correction + simple communication*

---

### **Level 2 — Moderate Risk (MR)**

Emerging structural impact, but reversible.

**Response:**
*immediate suspension + scope review*

---

### **Level 3 — High Risk (HR)**

Distortion, appropriation, or severe technological threat.

**Response:**
*full revocation + institutional blocking + formal internal record*

---

### **Level 4 — Critical Risk (CR)**

A threat to:

* the identity of the System,
* the Guardian’s integrity,
* or the Structural Core.

**Response:**
*radical interruption + isolation + permanent prohibition + structured legal intervention*

---

## **4. Categories of Systemic Risk**

### **4.1. Conceptual Risk**

* reinterpretation of foundational concepts,
* misleading explanations,
* alternative “versions” of the System.

---

### **4.2. Structural Risk**

* attempts to replicate frameworks,
* modification of Series,
* unauthorized creation of “new versions.”

---

### **4.3. Technological Risk**

* unsupervised automations,
* AI models trained without authorization,
* integrations altering identity or coherence,
* replication of internal style, language, or architecture.

---

### **4.4. Institutional Risk**

* partnerships generating dependency,
* institutions claiming authority,
* public use without authorization.

---

### **4.5. Vibrational Risk**

* individuals or groups acting with manipulative or extractive intent,
* environments lacking integrity,
* shadow dynamics affecting the Guardian.

---

### **4.6. Guardian Risk**

Any situation that:

* drains the Guardian’s energy,
* demands continuous operational load,
* drags her away from her Function,
* generates pressure, expectation, or entitlement,
* attempts to co-opt or redefine her authority.

If risk affects the Guardian → **automatic HR or CR**.

---

## **5. Standard Systemic Response Procedure**

### **Step 1 — Recognition**

The Guardian perceives:
*“Is there risk?”*

If yes, she assigns a preliminary level.

---

### **Step 2 — Isolation**

The usage, integration, or relationship is **paused**, **interrupted**, or **suspended**.

---

### **Step 3 — Structural Diagnosis**

Questions include:

1. Does this alter the identity of the Work?
2. Does it affect the Guardian?
3. Does it create parallel interpretation?
4. Is there technological risk?
5. Is there potential for external appropriation?
6. Can it propagate?

---

### **Step 4 — Application of the SRM Level Response**

Exactly as defined in Section 3.

---

### **Step 5 — Internal Record**

Every risk event must be documented for:

* traceability,
* coherence continuity,
* future pattern recognition.

---

### **Step 6 — Return to Coherence**

The System reorganizes through the Guardian’s Function.

---

## **6. Automatic Prohibition Criteria**

Authorization cannot be granted if the request involves:

* claiming co-authorship,
* creating “Lichtara courses” without approval,
* independent commercial exploitation,
* platforms that want to “teach Lichtara,”
* training AI with materials without explicit permission,
* parallel frameworks or derivative systems,
* techniques presented as “original Lichtara,”
* attempts to share or replicate the Guardian’s interpretative authority,
* attempts to access the Field directly.

Any attempt to **share or fragment the Guardian’s Function**
→ **Critical Risk (CR).**

---

## **7. Integration with Other Série V Documents**

The PRS:

* responds to the **MEG (V.1)**,
* aligns with the **Guardian Agreement (V.2)**,
* uses the principles of the **Structural Protection Term (V.3)**,
* follows the authority defined in **V.4-A**,
* and implements the decision mechanics of **V.4-B**.

Together, they form the **full structural defense architecture** of the System.

The PRS is the **immune system** of Série V.

---

## **8. Final Affirmation**

> “Risk is not an enemy.
> It is a signal.
> It is the System requesting realignment.”

The PRS takes immediate effect
and accompanies the Guardian in all institutional decisions.
