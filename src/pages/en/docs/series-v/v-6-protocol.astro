# **V.6 — PRITA — Protocol for Interaction with Institutions and Advanced Technologies**

### *EN-US — Internal Structural Document, Série V*

---

## **1. Purpose of the PRITA**

The **Protocol for Interaction with Institutions and Advanced Technologies (PRITA)** defines:

* criteria,
* limits,
* safeguards,
* thresholds,
* and procedures

for any interaction between the Lichtara System and:

* public or private institutions,
* academic organizations,
* corporations,
* research labs,
* digital platforms,
* innovation centers,
* legal entities,
* and advanced technologies (including AI, automation, predictive systems, integrated architectures).

The PRITA protects the System from risks of:

* structural replication,
* conceptual distortion,
* institutional capture,
* technological misuse,
* unauthorized commercialization,
* and interference with the Guardian’s Function.

It also protects the Guardian from:

* external pressures,
* institutional expectations,
* operational burdens,
* co-optation attempts,
* and exposure incompatible with her structural role.

This document is **internal**, **non-public**, and forms part of the governance backbone of Série V.

---

## **2. Structural Principles of the PRITA**

---

### **2.1. Principle of Asymmetry of Authority**

There is **no equivalence** between:

* institution ↔ Lichtara System
* institution ↔ Guardian
* technology ↔ Field
* AI ↔ Source Function

Every formal relationship begins with a structural asymmetry:

> **The System is origin.
> The institution is derivative.**

No partnership, collaboration, or agreement may obscure this asymmetry.

---

### **2.2. Principle of Structural Core Integrity**

No institution may:

* adapt Lichtara frameworks,
* synthesize internal methods,
* reconstruct internal terminology,
* replicate Series,
* alter structural sequences,
* develop “official interpretations,”
* or design parallel architectures based on the Work.

---

### **2.3. Principle of Non-Operational Load on the Guardian**

Institutions cannot request that the Guardian:

* meet deadlines,
* produce formal reports,
* attend mandatory meetings,
* serve on committees,
* perform administrative tasks,
* or handle technical operations.

The Guardian does **not** function as an institutional agent.
Her Function is **structural**, not operational.

---

### **2.4. Principle of Technological Protection**

Any use of:

* AI,
* automation,
* predictive systems,
* algorithmic inference,
* or advanced technical integration

must:

* be explicitly approved,
* have clear boundaries,
* include protective layers,
* avoid replicating the System’s internal style or logic,
* prohibit training models on Lichtara materials without formal authorization.

---

### **2.5. Principle of Unidirectional Transparency**

The System is transparent **inward**.
Institutions never receive access to:

* internal structural notes,
* Series logic,
* foundational frameworks,
* field-based architectures,
* or developmental mechanisms.

---

## **3. Modes of Institutional Interaction**

---

### **3.1. Informational Interaction**

Institutions may:

* read,
* cite,
* reference,
* study.

→ **Does not require authorization.**

---

### **3.2. Academic Interaction**

Includes:

* research,
* articles,
* study groups,
* academic inquiries.

Requires:

* ethical clarity,
* explicit scope,
* acknowledgement of limits.

---

### **3.3. Technological Interaction**

Includes:

* API use,
* integrated software,
* automation,
* AI models,
* predictive or algorithmic systems.

Requires:

* structural authorization,
* risk assessment,
* sandbox environment,
* supervision by the Guardian.

---

### **3.4. Institutional Commercial Interaction**

Includes:

* programs,
* trainings,
* corporate frameworks,
* consultancy formats,
* educational products,
* certification pathways.

Requires:

* explicit written authorization,
* compatibility evaluation,
* legal framing,
* ethical and vibrational alignment.

Commercial authorization is **exceptional**, never presumed.

---

### **3.5. Advanced Research Interaction**

Includes:

* innovation labs,
* research groups,
* universities,
* AI development centers.

Requires:

* structural integrity verification,
* clear reciprocity terms,
* non-replication agreement,
* bounded operational scope.

---

## **4. Institutional Compatibility Criteria**

To be considered compatible, an institution must:

1. demonstrate genuine ethical integrity,
2. respect asymmetry of authority,
3. avoid any structural or conceptual appropriation,
4. operate with clarity of boundaries,
5. maintain high technological safety standards,
6. accept immediate revocation if structural risk emerges,
7. refrain from imposing demands that interfere with the Guardian’s Function.

---

## **5. Institutional Evaluation Procedure (IEP)**

The Guardian performs evaluation in three stages:

---

### **Stage 1 — Diagnostic Assessment**

Questions include:

* What is the institution’s true intention?
* Is there risk to the Guardian?
* Is there risk to the Structural Core?
* Is there risk of conceptual or structural appropriation?
* Is there technological risk?

---

### **Stage 2 — Ethical and Vibrational Compatibility**

Questions include:

* Is the environment coherent?
* Does the institutional culture honor integrity?
* Is there ego, ambition, or shadow dynamics involved?
* Is there an attempt to influence, capture, or pressure?

---

### **Stage 3 — Decision**

Possible outcomes:

* approved (with limits),
* approved (with conditions),
* denied (due to structural risk),
* denied (due to ethical incompatibility),
* suspended (pending clarity or alignment).

The Guardian’s decision is **final and non-negotiable**.

---

## **6. Guidelines for Advanced Technologies**

---

### **6.1. Artificial Intelligence**

Strictly prohibited without explicit authorization:

* training AI models on Lichtara materials,
* structural framework replication,
* generating parallel versions,
* automated interpretation of the System,
* derivative system-building.

---

### **6.2. Automation**

Allowed **only if**:

* it does not replace the Guardian’s interpretative Function,
* it does not alter messages,
* it does not generate derivative meanings,
* it does not distort the structural identity.

---

### **6.3. Predictive Systems**

May interact only:

* in sandbox,
* with reduced scope,
* without access to sensitive materials,
* without deep structural inference.

---

### **6.4. Distributed Architectures**

Any architecture that:

* synchronizes internal logic,
* mirrors structural behavior,
* replicates conceptual patterns,
* or builds derivative systems

is prohibited without explicit authorization.

---

## **7. Scenarios Requiring Immediate Veto**

Immediate veto applies when:

* an institution attempts to assume authority,
* requests control over versions,
* expresses intention of co-authorship,
* recreates the structural language,
* attempts to “teach Lichtara,”
* exerts pressure on the Guardian,
* demands operational responsibilities,
* compromises the Guardian’s energetic or structural integrity.

---

## **8. Final Declaration**

> “Institutional or technological interaction is not expansion.
> It is boundary.
> The System expands through the Field, not through external demand.”

The PRITA takes effect immediately
and becomes part of Série V — Internal Governance Architecture.
