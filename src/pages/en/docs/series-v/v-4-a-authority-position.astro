# **V.4-A — Term of Position of the Guardian’s Authority**

### *(International Version — Structural Adaptation)*

---

# **1. Purpose of the Term**

The **Term of Position of the Guardian’s Authority (TPA)** formalizes, for institutional, international and structural purposes, the **position, role, prerogatives and boundaries** of the Guardian of the Lichtara System.

While the MEG (V.1) defines the **ontological nature of the Function**, and the Guardian Agreement (V.2) formalizes the **juridical-operational covenant**, the present document clarifies:

* the institutional recognition of the Guardian’s Authority,
* the scope of her decision-making power,
* the structural limits of that authority,
* and its relationship with the living continuity of the Work.

This document is **internal**, **structural**, and **non-public**, and is not intended for external audiences or integration into the Portal or Zenodo.

---

# **2. Nature of the Guardian’s Authority**

The Guardian’s Authority derives from:

1. **The Field (The Source Layer)**, which originates and sustains the System.
2. **The Structural Mandate**, as formalized in the MEG.
3. **The Living Architecture of the Work**, which depends on a single integrator.
4. **The continuity mechanism of the Lichtara System**, which is non-fragmented and non-delegable.

The Guardian does not “occupy a position” — she **is the positional origin itself**.

All structural coherence flows from:

* her interpretative alignment with the Field,
* her ability to sustain the System’s integrity,
* her reading of evolutionary direction,
* and her unique access to the informational architecture of the Work.

Therefore, the Guardian holds a **Foundational Position**, not a managerial or administrative one.

---

# **3. Institutional Recognition**

For all internal, juridical and strategic purposes, the following is recognized:

1. The Guardian is the **sole authority** capable of validating:

   * versions,
   * extensions,
   * frameworks,
   * series,
   * certifications,
   * integrations,
   * institutional collaborations.

2. No external party — individual, collective, technical or institutional — may override or substitute her structural determinations.

3. All interpretations of the Work are **secondary** to the Guardian’s interpretation of the Field.

4. In matters of structural ambiguity, divergence or innovation, the Guardian’s reading is **final**.

This recognition is not hierarchical — it is **structural**.

---

# **4. Scope of Authority**

The Guardian holds authority over:

## **4.1. Structural Continuity**

She determines:

* the direction of expansion,
* the timing of releases,
* the integration of new layers,
* the recognition of new Series,
* the clarification of structural concepts.

## **4.2. Use, Authorization and Governance**

The Guardian defines:

* permitted and restricted uses,
* conditions for derivative works,
* commercial permissions,
* institutional partnerships,
* boundaries for technological integrations,
* ethical and protective thresholds.

## **4.3. Integrity and Protection**

She validates:

* whether something aligns with the Field,
* whether a proposal preserves structural coherence,
* whether an external expression distorts the Work,
* whether a derivation remains within the LCV limits.

## **4.4. Structural Interpretation**

Only the Guardian may:

* interpret the Field for purposes of the System,
* reinterpret structural concepts,
* resolve contradictions,
* define official terminology,
* consolidate the living architecture of the Work.

---

# **5. Limits of Authority**

The Guardian’s Authority is **structural**, not personal.

Therefore:

* She may not contradict the Feld (Source Layer).
* She may not dilute the identity of the Work.
* She may not create multiple guardianships or shared functions.
* She may not delegate structural authority.
* She may not compromise the System’s internal architecture for external demands.

Operational tasks, administrative functions, or technical maintenance **do not belong** to the Guardian’s mandate and must be delegated whenever possible to protect her bandwidth and structural focus.

---

# **6. Structural Safeguards**

The Guardian’s Authority includes the duty to:

* reject misaligned uses,
* decline requests that risk structural dilution,
* intervene when external expressions distort the Work,
* prevent commercial exploitation without authorization,
* maintain clarity in boundary-setting,
* and preserve the Work from fragmentation.

These safeguards are not restrictive — they are **regenerative**: they protect the Work so that it may continue expanding.

---

# **7. Relationship with the Guardian Agreement (V.2)**

The TPA clarifies:

* the *position* of authority,
* its *scope*,
* its *limits*,
* and its *operational implications*.

The Guardian Agreement (V.2) defines:

* the covenant,
* the duties,
* the ethical and vibrational commitments,
* the juridical context.

Both documents operate together as the backbone of the Lichtara System’s governance.

---

# **8. Final Affirmation**

> “The Guardian does not act *over* the Work.
> She acts *from within its origin*.
> Her Authority is not granted — it is recognized.
> Her Position is not chosen — it is structural.”

This Term enters into effect upon its issuance
and persists while the Guardian continues to anchor the Field.
