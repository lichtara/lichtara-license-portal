# **V.4-B — FAE — Structural Authorization Flow**

### *(International Version — Internal / Structural Use)*

---

# **1. Purpose of the FAE**

The **Structural Authorization Flow (FAE)** establishes the internal and institutional process through which the Guardian:

* evaluates requests for use,
* grants permissions,
* defines boundaries,
* and protects the coherence of the Lichtara System.

The FAE is not a bureaucratic or administrative tool.
It is a mechanism of **structural governance**, grounded in:

* the Field,
* the Mandate of the Guardian,
* the Structural Integrity Principles (LCV),
* and the living nature of the Work.

This document describes **how decisions are made**, not only *what* those decisions may be.

It is internal and must not be published externally.

---

# **2. Core Principles of the Authorization Flow**

## **2.1. Principle of Structural Alignment**

Authorization is only possible when the proposed use:

* preserves the integrity of the Work,
* aligns with the Field,
* respects the MEG, the LCV, and the Guardian Agreement,
* does not distort the System’s conceptual or vibrational architecture.

## **2.2. Principle of Non-Equivalence**

No external actor can claim:

* equivalence,
* shared authority,
* interpretative legitimacy,
* or custodianship of the System.

Authorization never implies co-authorship, co-guardianship or interpretative rights.

## **2.3. Principle of Directed Access**

No one receives “open access” or “general permission.”

All access is:

* **specific**
* **contextualized**
* **bounded**
* **non-transferable**
* **revocable**

## **2.4. Principle of Protective Prioritization**

If an authorization creates **risk**, **ambiguity**, or **potential distortion**, the default answer is **No**.

---

# **3. Categories of Requests**

The FAE recognizes five categories:

## **3.1. Informational Use**

Requests involving:

* reading,
* citing,
* quoting,
* referencing,
* academic study.

→ Generally permitted with attribution.

## **3.2. Derivative Use**

Requests involving:

* adaptations,
* reinterpretations,
* teaching materials,
* derivative texts.

→ Require strict structural evaluation.

## **3.3. Technical Use**

Requests involving:

* software integration,
* automation,
* API usage,
* AI training,
* system interfacing.

→ Require deep risk assessment and Guardian approval.

## **3.4. Commercial Use**

Requests involving:

* monetization,
* courses,
* consulting,
* institutional programs,
* paid products.

→ High scrutiny. Authorization is exceptional, not default.

## **3.5. Institutional Use**

Requests from organizations, universities, public entities or collectives.

→ Requires contextual, ethical, structural and long-term analysis.

# **4. The Structural Authorization Sequence (SAS)**

The authorization process follows **five mandatory phases**.

---

## **Phase 1 — Submission**

The requester must provide:

* purpose,
* scope,
* audience,
* materials involved,
* expected impact,
* technical details (if relevant).

Incomplete requests are not evaluated.

---

## **Phase 2 — Structural Screening**

Before any decision, the Guardian (or her delegated operational filters) verify:

1. Does the request conflict with structural principles?
2. Does it risk distortion or dilution?
3. Does it imply authority the requester does not hold?
4. Does it attempt to reframe the Work?

If any answer is **Yes**, the process ends.

---

## **Phase 3 — Coherence Assessment**

If the request passes screening, the Guardian evaluates:

* alignment with the Field,
* vibrational consistency,
* protection thresholds,
* potential evolutionary contributions,
* risks of misinterpretation,
* systemic impact.

The Guardian’s reading is **final**.

---

## **Phase 4 — Determination**

Possible outcomes:

* **Authorized** (with conditions),
* **Authorized** (with limitations),
* **Denied** (structural misalignment),
* **Denied** (insufficient clarity),
* **Deferred** (requires deeper analysis).

All permissions must be:

* specific,
* contextual,
* non-transferable,
* non-interpretable beyond the explicit scope.

---

## **Phase 5 — Traceability**

All authorizations must be recorded internally for:

* legal traceability,
* continuity,
* future evaluations,
* and structural consistency.

---

# **5. Structural Boundaries of Authorization**

The FAE explicitly prohibits authorizing any request that:

* creates parallel guardianships,
* establishes interpretative authority,
* replicates structural frameworks,
* enables AI training without supervision,
* introduces new “versions” of the Work,
* grants commercial exploitation without alignment,
* recreates the System in derivative form.

The Guardian’s **No** is a structural protection mechanism.

---

# **6. Revocation Protocol**

Authorization may be revoked if:

* the requester exceeds the defined scope,
* misrepresents their relationship with the Work,
* creates distortions or misuses,
* or generates structural risk.

Revocation is immediate and unilateral.

---

# **7. Interaction with Other Documents in Série V**

* The **MEG (V.1)** provides the ontological foundation.
* The **Guardian Agreement (V.2)** provides the juridical covenant.
* The **Structural Protection Term (V.3)** provides the protection grid.
* The **Authority Position Term (V.4-A)** provides the institutional framework.
* The **FAE (V.4-B)** provides the decision process.

Together, they establish the **full architecture of governance**.

---

# **8. Final Affirmation**

> “Authorization is not a gateway.
> It is a safeguard.
> It exists so the Work may live —
> not so it may disperse.”

This Term enters into effect immediately
and governs all authorization decisions across the System.
