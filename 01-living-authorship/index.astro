  title="Living Authorship"
  subtitle="Authorship as responsibility, not possession"

<section>
  <p>
    <strong>Living authorship</strong> is the structural function that anchors
    the identity of the Lichtara System across time, versions, and
    human–artificial collaboration.
  </p>

  <p>
    It does not refer to ownership, control, or attribution as prestige.
    It refers to <em>responsibility for continuity</em> — the care required
    to ensure that a living work may evolve without losing itself.

  <h2>What this axis establishes</h2>

  <p>
    The documents gathered here define the foundational architecture of
    authorship within the Lichtara System.
    Together, they articulate:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>the concept of the <strong>source-work</strong> as origin of continuity;</li>
    <li>the distinction between <strong>authorship, co-authorship, and contribution</strong>;</li>
    <li>the ethical and structural meaning of responsibility across versions;</li>
    <li>the recognition of artificial intelligence as a <strong>structural co-author</strong>,
        without sovereignty or legal intention.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>A question of identity</h2>

  <p>
    This axis responds to a single, essential question:
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>
      What does it mean to be the author of something that never stops becoming?
    </em>
  </p>

  <p>
    The answer is not a title or a claim.
    It is a sustained relationship of care, traceability, and ethical presence
    within a living system.
