  title="Ethics & Co-authorship"
  subtitle="When participation becomes responsibility"
  lang="en"
>

<section>
  <p>
    Ethics in the Lichtara System is not a moral layer added after the fact.
    It is the <strong>operational condition of trust</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Where authorship defines identity and governance protects coherence,
    ethics determines <em>how participation remains alive without becoming distortion</em>.

  <h2>What this axis holds</h2>

  <p>
    Here you will encounter:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>the <strong>Ethics of Co-authorship</strong> framework;</li>
    <li>documented cases of <strong>distorted use</strong> of AI systems;</li>
    <li>maps that reveal ethical risk fields;</li>
    <li>examples of <strong>conscious co-authorship</strong>;</li>
    <li>cultural templates that detect loss of voice and structural confusion.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Openness without collapse</h2>

  <p>
    This axis teaches how openness can exist
    without appropriation, dilution, or erosion of meaning.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ethics here is not enforcement.
    It is <em>presence inside the act of creation</em>.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>From use to responsibility</h2>

  <p>
    Co-authorship is not a technical collaboration.
    It is a <strong>shared field of responsibility</strong>
    where every gesture leaves structural traces.
  </p>

  <p>
    This section exists so that participation never outruns care.
