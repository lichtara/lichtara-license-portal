Title: Ethics & Co-authorship

Subtitle: When participation becomes responsibility.

Body:

Ethics in the Lichtara System is not a moral layer added later.
It is the operational condition of trust.

Here you will encounter:

the Ethics of Co-authorship

cases of distorted use

conscious co-authorship practices

cultural templates that detect loss of voice and structural confusion

This axis teaches how openness can exist
without appropriation, dilution or collapse of meaning.
